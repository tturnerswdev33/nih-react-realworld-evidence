COVID-19 or requiring new or increased oxygenation support.
Patients were included if they completed bamlanivimab
treatment and had at least 28 calendar days of follow-up, or if
they experienced one of the study outcomes of interest within
28 days after treatment",,"In this observational study of outpatients eligible to receive bamlanivimab for COVID-19, we created within age strata propensity scores for receipt of mAb, matched those receiving bamlanivimab treatment to eligible patients not receiving treatment in a 1:5 ratio, and then calculated the odds ratios (OR) of
study outcomes. First, we selected from the at-risk comparator population individuals
matched by propensity score (Supplemental Figure 1) [11,
12]. Age is a strong predictor for complications of COVID-19, and
the prevalence of high-risk medical conditions vary substantially
by patient age [13, 14]. We anticipated that differences in patient
profiles between treated and nontreated patients would vary by age
because of the age-specific criteria for bamlanivimab contained in
the EUA. Moreover, immunosenescence occurs with aging, so we
anticipated age to be a potential effect modifier in the relationship
between mAb receipt and study outcomes [15]. Therefore,
we planned a priori to select nontreated patients using propensity
scores within age strata consistent with the EUA criteria: less than
55 years, 55 years to less than 65 years, and 65 years of age and
older [10]. Patients receiving bamlanivimab treatment and the
selected comparator patients across all age strata were then combined
to constitute the study population.
Propensity scores were derived using logistic regression
models fit from covariates in age-stratified groups with treatment
with mAb as the response variable and forward stepwise
selection of measured pretreatment explanatory variables at
P < .15 (Supplemental Table 2). We included variables deemed
biologically relevant into all models before stepwise selection.
We used 1:5 propensity score matching with a maximum propensity
score probability difference of 0.01 to construct matched
treated and nontreated groups within age strata (Supplemental
Figures 1 and 2). We did not impute missing values for variables
used in deriving the propensity scores, but we did compare
characteristics of patients with propensity scores (ie, full
covariate data) to those without propensity scores.
We compared characteristics and unadjusted outcomes of
treated versus nontreated patients using Student t tests for continuous
variables and χ 2 tests for categorical variables. The time
at risk for nontreated patients was estimated starting at the time
they would have received bamlanivimab had they been referred
for care, conservatively using 2 days after SARS-CoV-2 testing.
We compared the distribution of time from beginning of follow-
up to study outcome among patients receiving treatment
and those who did not, both in the matched and at-risk populations
(Supplemental Table 3). For the propensity-matched analysis
of primary and secondary outcomes, as well as individual
elements of the composite outcomes, we fit unconditional logistic
regression models with bamlanivimab receipt as the primary
exposure.
We also performed 1 sensitivity and 3 exploratory analyses.
First, we used the propensity score (ie, predicted probability
of being treated with bamlanivimab) as a continuous variable
to control for confounding and evaluate study outcomes in
the unmatched cohort of patients who did and did not receive
bamlanivimab. Second, because we postulated that treatment
may have differential effects in potentially immunosenescent
older population, we evaluated the association between
bamlanivimab and study outcomes in the predefined age strata
of the propensity score-matched cohort. Third, in the unmatched
cohort, we tested for an interaction between treatment
and BMI because in one clinical trial higher BMI was associated
with a more pronounced treatment effect [16]. Fourth, to
identify a potential benefit of prompt (versus delayed) administration
of bamlanivimab, among study patients receiving it, we
explored the frequency of treatment outcomes in 4 categories
of time from diagnosis to treatment: 0 to 2 days, 3 to 4 days,
5 to 7 days, and 8 to 10 days. Treatment effects are reported as
risk-adjusted OR with 95% confidence interval (CI). We set the
alpha error at 0.05 for calculation of adjusted OR. All analyses
were performed using the SAS System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC),

weights. Participants’ follow-up accrued from the date ofinfusion until the date of hospitalisation, death or date of
discharge. Administrative censoring was also applied at 31/12/2021 the date at which the database was frozen. Weights have
been calculated using the predicted values from the pooled logistic models for the probabilities of starting BAM/ETE vs.
CAS/IMD and those of censoring, respectively. Treatment was fitted as a time-fixed variable and there was no need to account
for immortal time bias. Potential informative censoring was controlled for using inverse probability of censoring weights.
Unweighted and weighted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were shown. Assumptions regarding
the underlying causal link between measured factors are pictured in Figure 1. Unweighted and weighting Kaplan-Meier estimates
of the primary outcome stratified by treatment strategy were fitted. Interactions between the intervention and study
population strata (type of VoC, vaccination status, baseline SARS-COV-2 serology, level of D1 CT values and period of
enrolment) were formally tested by including a multiplicative term in the marginal Cox regression model and adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were shown in a forest plot. Positive serology was defined as detection of IgG and/or IgA
with ELISA or detection of IgG anti-S and/or anti-N by CMIA. We compared mean CT values at D7 by treatment in analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA- model adjusted for D1 CT value, month of enrolment and type of VoC) and we described, using
box-plots, median (IQR) of D1 and D7 CT values and its variation. We also evaluated the associations between D7 CT response
(using the cut-offs of 40 for negativity and 25 for reduced viral
load) with both the intervention and the primary outcome using a chi-square and Fisher exact test as appropriate.
A descriptive analysis of self-reported side effects was also performed.A two-sided test of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

According to the to manufacturer’s instructions, for the two CMIA, Index >1.4 and Binding Antibody Units (BAU)/mL ≥7.1 are considered positive for anti-N and anti-Spike/RBD IgG, respectively.

Semi-quantitative estimation of viral load in NPS was assessed by RT-PCR using DiaSorin Simplexa® COVID-19 Direct platform (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), based on cycle threshold (CT) values of S and ORF1ab genes amplification.

First, matching of nontreated controls used EUA-eligible
risk factors only, and we were unable to determine the time
from symptom onset to SARS-CoV-2 test positive result or
symptom severity (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) of
patients. We postulate that many nontreated patients may
have been asymptomatic (ie, due to routine SARS-CoV-2 testing
or incidental findings) and thereby at low risk of hospitalization,
which would tend to bias results against mAb
treatment. Second, as previously stated, we were unable to determine
vaccination status (including booster status) in all patients,
and the definition of “fully vaccinated” has changed
dramatically with updated dosing schedules and authorization
of additional vaccines. Third, receipt of tixagevimab/cilgavimab
was not assessed, and we were unable to assess other treatments
outside of our health system for control (untreated)
patients, although, 3-day remdesivir was not offered by
UPMC or any other regional hospital. Fourth, Omicron and
its sublineages were the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants during
the study period, yet no patient-specific genotype sampling
was conducted. Fifth, our definition of “immunocompromised”
is broad, with multiple qualifying conditions. Sixth,
hospitalizations that may have occurred outside the UPMC system
are not captured in the present analyses. Finally, we cannot
rule out potential residual confounding of the estimated mAb
treatment effects despite our close propensity score matching

Missing laboratory data (appendix 2 p 2) for molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir–ritonavir recipients were imputed 20 times using other data in the propensity-score model.22 We applied Rubin’s rules to pool the treatment effects estimated from the 20 independent imputed datasets.23 We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to assess the balance of each baseline covariate between the groups before and after propensity-score matching,
with an SMD greater than 0·1 indicating covariate
imbalance.24
Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for each outcome
between molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir–ritonavir recipients

regression models. Because Schoenfeld residuals showed
no evidence that the proportional hazards assumption
had been violated, we assumed proportionality of HRs in
the primary analysis. A cluster-robust sandwich variance–
covariance estimator was used in all Cox regression
models to account for the correlation within the
propensity-score match. Mean differences (95% CIs) for
the length of hospital stay endpoint were calculated using
linear regression. Analyses were done among the

inclusion if they received the Covid-19 diagnosis
on or before February 24, 2022. Eligibility for

drug interactions and other contraindications,
as described in the nirmatrelvir prescribing information.","Patients who were residing in long-term
care facilities and patients who had been hospitalized
before or on the same day as a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test were excluded from the study,
as were patients who had received treatment
with molnupiravir or with the anti–SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cil
gavimab.","All eligible CHS members were included in the analysis, in accordance with the study design.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study patients. Because the independent variable
(nirmatrelvir treatment) varied over time, univariate and multivariate survival analyses were
performed with time-dependent covariates. For patients who did not receive treatment
with nirmatrelvir, time zero corresponded to the time at which each patient received a diagnosis
of Covid-19. For patients who received treatment with nirmatrelvir, time zero corresponded to the
time at which a patient began the treatment. In order to avoid immortal time bias,8 we performed
a time-dependent analysis in which a time-varying covariate was used to indicate the
initiation of treatment for each treated patient. In this analysis, patients who received nirmatrelvir
were transferred from the “untreated” risk set to the “treated” risk set when treatment was
initiated, thereby modifying their treatment status from untreated to treated. Consequently, the
follow-up of nirmatrelvir-treated patients started at the end of the immortal period.
A sensitivity analysis assessed the effect size of nirmatrelvir treatment beginning on day 3 of
follow-up by excluding patients who had been hospitalized within 2 days after the start of follow-
up. This approach allowed for comparability with the EPIC-HR trial, in which patients were
excluded if the need for hospitalization within 2 days after randomization was anticipated.4
The association between nirmatrelvir therapy and Covid-19 outcomes was estimated with the use of a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards
regression model with time-dependent covariates; adjustment was made for sociodemographic
factors and coexisting illnesses. Given that many clinical and sociodemographic factors are potential confounders, two-step testing
criteria were applied for the selection of covariates. First, a univariate Kaplan–Meier analysis
with a log-rank test was applied to evaluate the associations between each independent candidate
variable and the time-dependent primary outcome. Then, a comparison of the survival
curves and Schoenfeld’s global test was used to test the proportional-hazards assumption for
those variables. Variates that met these two testing criteria served as the inputs for the multivariate
regression analysis. An additional multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression
model was used to estimate the association between each of the covariates and uptake of nirmatrelvir therapy. R statistical software, version 3.5.0 (R Foundation),
was used for the univariate and multivariate
survival analyses with time-dependent
covariates. SPSS software, version 26 (IBM), was
used for all other statistical analyses.",,,"The mean age of the study patients
was 60 years; 39% of the patients were 65 years
of age or older, and 60% were women. The most
common coexisting conditions were obesity,

data where nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir was randomly
assigned among outpatients with early COVID-19 in the
context of high prevalence of prior immunity and the
currently circulating variants. To mitigate immortal
person-time bias and align with the design of EPICHR,
only patients who were alive, had not received
other authorized treatments for early COVID-19 (molnupiravir,
remdesivir, or the anti–SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal
antibodies sotrovimab and bebtelovimab), and were not
hospitalized through 2 calendar days (day of diagnosis and
subsequent day) were included. Eligibility was assessed
and study group was assigned at the end of the second calendar
day, and hospitalizations and deaths after that time
were considered end points. Patients prescribed nirmatrelvir
plus ritonavir or another authorized treatment after 2 calendar
days from diagnosis were retained in their originally
assigned study group. The trial emulation is described further
in the Supplement Table (available at Annals.org).
We anticipated bias in the prescription of nirmatrelvir
plus ritonavir related to vaccination, medical history, health
care access, and other patient factors. To better achieve
exchangeability between patients prescribed and not
prescribed nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir, we used an inverse
probability–weighted design. Treatment weights were
generated using a logistic model that included a priori–
determined factors of age (50 to 64, 65 to 79, or ≥80 years),
comorbidity score (Monoclonal Antibody Screening Score
≤3, 4 or 5, or ≥6), vaccination status (unvaccinated, partially
vaccinated, vaccinated, or vaccinated and ≥1 booster dose),
recency of last vaccine dose (<20 weeks or >20 weeks,
based on observed decreased protection against severe
disease [12]), self-reported race and ethnicity (Hispanic or
Latinx, White non-Hispanic and non-Latinx, Black non-
Hispanic and non-Latinx, Asian non-Hispanic and non-
Latinx, or other or unavailable), study period (January to
April or May to July), and neighborhood disadvantage
(<75th or >75th percentile of Area Deprivation Index [10,
11] of participant cohort census block groups). The treatment
weights were used to generate a pseudo-population
(13) to estimate the effect of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir if prescribing
was not biased on the basis of the included factors.
Modified Poisson models using robust error variance (14)

The 30-day rate of hospitalization or death was similar between molnupiravir-treated (44.59 events per 1000 persons) and untreated groups (57.88 events per 1000 persons) overall, with a RD of -13.29 events per 1000 persons (95% CI -29.44 to 2.87) and RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.08, Figure 3, Table 2). However, among persons aged 65 years and older, receipt of molnupiravir was associated with a lower 30-day risk of hospitalization or death (RD -27.10 events per 1000 persons, 95% CI -50.63 to -3.58; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99, Supplemental Tables 12, 13). There was a significant reduction in absolute risk of death (RD -7.53 events per 1000 persons, 95% CI -14.89 to -0.16) although the relative risk was not significant (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.13). Molnupiravir versus nirmatrelvir-ritonavir
The 30-day rate of hospitalization or death was 39.01 events per 1000 persons in the
molnupiravir arm compared with 24.71 events per 1000 persons in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir arm,
an insignificant rate difference of -14.30 events per 1000 persons (95% CI -33.20 to 4.59,
Figure 3, Table 2). Compared with molnupiravir-treated participants, there was a significant
reduction in absolute risk of death among nirmatrelvir-ritonavir-treated participants (RD -7.89
events per 1000 persons, 95% CI -15.00 to -0.61) although the relative risk was not significant
(RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.16). There were no significant differences in hospitalization.
Long-term outcomes
There was no significant difference in 31-180-day incidence of acute or long-term care
admission or death between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and no treatment groups (Figure 4, Table 3).
Incidence of acute or long-term care admission was 123.0 events per 1000 persons in the
molnupiravir arm compared with 82.5 events per 1000 persons in the no treatment arm
(subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.99). There was no significant difference in
mortality (SHR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.89) between these groups. Compared to the no treatment
arm, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir arm had a lower incidence of renal conditions (44.2 versus 65.1
events per 100 persons, SHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). There were otherwise no significant

Paxlovid appears to be more effective in older patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with underlying neurological or cardiovascular disease (interaction P .05 for all). No significant  interaction was detected between Paxlovid treatment and COVID-19 vaccination status.; Next Overall, 942 events occurred in all 180 351 included patients, reflecting a crude incidence rate of 5.6 per 1000 person-months. The crude incidence rate was 3.4 per 1000 person-months in vaccinated patients and 13.4 per 1000 person-months in unvaccinated

decreased risk for the composite of severe COVID-19 or mortality (HR, 0.20 [95% CI, .17–.22]) (Table 2). Age, male sex, low SES, belonging to the Arab population sector, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, neurological disease, malignancy, and
immunosuppression were retained in the Cox multivariable model and were all associated with increased risk for the composite
of severe COVID-19 or mortality. Of them, immunosuppression, neurological disease, and malignancy had the
strongest association, with HRs of 6.43 (95% CI, 4.95–8.34), 2.28 (95% CI, 1.95–2.67), and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.54–3.00), respectively.

Using ED visits as a surrogate for severe and/or recurrent symptoms during the treatment phase, we did not observe a higher ED visit rate in NMV-r treated patients as compared to untreated patients, and thus cannot conclude that treatment with NMV-r induces severe rebound symptoms.","Real-world evidence during an Omicron BA.2/BA2.12.1 predominant period demonstrated
an association of NMV-r treatment with reduced 28-day hospitalization and all-cause mortality, and
without an increase in rebound symptoms as assessed by ED visits within 28 days after treatment.; Next NMV-r was associated
with a lower incidence of the primary outcome of 28-day all-cause hospitalization, and associated with a
lower incidence of 28-day all-cause hospitalization using a more restrictive definition of COVID-related
hospitalization. NMV-r administration to high-risk outpatients was also associated with a reduction in
COVID illness severity, as evidenced by a reduction in all-cause 28-day mortality, and suggestion of
reduced levels of maximal respiratory support, ICU needs, or hospital length of stay. Therefore, despite waning COVID severity and increasing numbers of non-specific hospitalizations among COVID-positive
patients, we observed a strong association of benefit for NMV-r against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron during a
BA.2/BA2.12.1 phase.
The other major finding of this study was that NMV-r was not associated with an increase in ED
visits in the 28 days following its administration, and particularly in the 10-14 days after anticipated
completion of the treatment course, as compared to matched, untreated control patients. These data
suggest that patients who are treated with NMV-r may not develop severe rebound symptoms that lead
to ED evaluation with greater frequency than untreated individuals.; Next This study of real-world data demonstrated NMV-r treatment was associated with reduced 28-day
hospitalization and all-cause 28-day mortality among high-risk COVID-19 outpatients during the Omicron
BA.2/BA2.12.1 variant phase in Colorado. Using ED visits as a surrogate for severe and/or recurrent

hospitalization as compared to no antiviral treatment [31 (0.9%) vs. 64 (1.3%), adjusted odds ratio (aOR):

Treatment with NMV-r was associated with significantly lower odds of 28-day all cause hospitalization as

approximately 80% of all hospitalizations, and among this subset the odds of 28-day hospitalization
among NMV-r treated were reduced to a similar level compared to no antiviral treatment [23 (0.6%) vs.
52 (1.1%), aOR (95% CI): 0.42 (0.25-0.68), p < 0.001].
Secondary Outcomes
28-day all-cause mortality, a key indicator of severity of illness, was significantly lower among those
treated with NMV-r compared to untreated patients [0 (0.0%) vs. 9 (0.2%), aOR (95% CI): 0.05 (0.00-
0.38), p = 0.001] (Table 2). Furthermore, among the subset of hospitalized patients in our cohort, the
need for high flow nasal oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death was lower in NMV-r treated
patients compared to untreated patients (6.4% vs. 10.9%), though inferential statistics could not be
performed due to low event rates (Figure 2).; Next Overall, the NMV-r treated group had similar odds of ED

comorbidities were also evaluated (Table 3). Treatment effect differed only based on the number of
comorbid conditions; although statistical significance was marginal (Table 3; p=0.059). In those with 2+

hospitalized participants, we present only descriptive statistics for all exploratory outcomes among

(11.8%), hyperglycaemia (11.0%), acute renal injury/failure (8.9%), anaemia (8.1%) and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (7.2%) (Supplementary Table 8). The remdesivir group had

A total of 140/1,507 (9.3%) remdesivir patients and 565/4,734 (11.9%) controls died within 14 days of

and viral pneumonia was 0.80 with 95% CI (0.60-1.07), p=0.116. Sensitivity analyses did not change
inference (see Supplementary Material).
Secondary Outcomes
Time-to-recovery was found to vary with time and treatment (Figure 3A). During days 1-5, recovery
was more likely in controls; during days 6-8 there was no treatment effect; and for days 9-28,
remdesivir was associated with a faster recovery (Table 3). Median (IQR) time to recovery was 9 (9-
10) days for remdesivir, and 8 (8-9) days for controls. There is evidence to suggest that reduction in
28-day mortality is associated with remdesivir (Table 2): the p-value is 0.03, but uncorrected for
multiplicity; this can be interpreted as an estimated 36 (95% CI: 20- 290) patients needed to treat to
prevent one death. Time-to-death over these 28 days was not significantly associated with treatment
group (Figure 3B, Table 3)). Five clinical status classifications were derivable at day 15 (see
Supplementary Material). Ordinal regression of this outcome indicates no evidence of an association
with treatment group (Table 2). The proportional odds assumption was checked and found to hold.

was published on the ISARIC website on 16th December [21]. This was subject to internal clinical and
statistical review. The manufacturer was given opportunity to comment on the SAP - this was
discretionary, and suggested revisions were considered prior to finalisation; none were considered
substantive, and the proposed methodology was unchanged.
A formal sample size calculation was not undertaken. No upper boundary was placed on sample size.
The number of controls eligible for the study could not be predicted, but the total was expected to be
greater than the number that received remdesivir.
Likelihood of receiving remdesivir according to patients’ baseline characteristics was modelled using
logistic regression. Baseline factors were prespecified in the SAP, chosen to be potentially associated
with likelihood of receiving remdesivir, or known a priori to be associated with short-term mortality
[22]. These were: month of baseline; ISARIC4C tier of participating centre (0/1/2); sex; age; broad
ethnicity group (White/Asian/Black/Other); clinically extremely vulnerable status (Yes [Any of the
following: cancer, severe respiratory condition, on immunosuppression therapy, other]/None/
Unknown); diabetes; hypertension; obesity; chronic cardiac disease (CCD); chronic pulmonary disease
(CPD); asthma; where COVID-19 was acquired (community/hospital); admitted to HDU or ICU at
baseline (Yes/No). Several models were fitted (see Supplementary Material) using different strategies
of model selection. Propensity scores were calculated under each model, and a potential set of
controls selected: each remdesivir patient was matched to up to four controls with a similar propensity
score (calliper-width 0.2 standard deviations [23]); controls were chosen without replacement.
Underlying probability of death at 14-days was modelled using logistic regression in eligible nonremdesivir
patients and used to calculate a disease risk score for each patient in the study. A balance
statistic was calculated for each propensity score model using weighted standardised difference in risk
score (ASDRS). An optimal propensity score model was selected minimising ASDRS. A pre-defined
balance diagnostic threshold: ASDRS ≤ 0.1 [24] was used to indicate adequate balance. Further details
and rationale for methods are given in supplementary material.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics, other baseline characteristics including
pre-existing comorbidities, treatments received during hospitalisation, and complications associated
with hospitalisation. Outcomes were summarised by treatment group, but inference was obtained
through multivariable modelling, adjusting for confounders to increase robustness. Confounders
chosen a priori (sex, age-group, and number of key comorbidities) were identified by Knight et al [22]
as being key underlying predictors of short-term mortality in COVID-19. We allowed for additional factors to be added to outcome models after seeing the data. Models incorporated weights for the
control group to account for the variable matching ratio (wj = 1/kj) where kj is the number of controls
matched to remdesivir patient j). Stuart [23] suggests that for analysis purposes, the two groups may
be treated as independent. Binary outcomes were modelled using logistic regression; time-to-event
outcomes with Cox Proportional-Hazards modelling (partitioning the time axis and estimating hazardratios
within sub-intervals should proportional hazards not hold); ordinal outcomes with ordinal
logistic regression. The primary outcome analysis was subject to sensitivity analyses regarding
specification of the logistic regression model. Propensity score matching was carried out using MatchIt

Remdesivir recipients and controls had similar HRs for mortality within 30 days in Cox proportional; next hazards regression models (adjusted HR, 1.06; 95%CI, 0.83-1.36). Mortality at 30 days was also
similar among subgroups of patients receiving and not receiving dexamethasone treatment at

nonrecipients: adjusted HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.84-1.69) (Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in
eFigures 3 and 4 in the Supplement). Results were similar in a sensitivity analysis that compared
patients who initiated remdesivir treatment within 48 hours of admission with matched controls

m3. This left 5898 patients in the initial study cohort","We used 2methods to address confounding by indication and the time-dependent nature of
treatment and illness severity. Our primarymethod involved propensity score matching of patients
initiating remdesivir treatment to control patients who had not initiated remdesivir treatment by the
same hospital day. To ensure consistency of the results,we also applied an alternate approach using
marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weights by hospital day, following
the method of Hernán et al and Robins et al,18,19 and compared the findings.
The matching strategy using propensity scores by hospital day is described in detail in eFigure 1
in the Supplement. In brief, we created a separate record for each day of acute care stay for each
patient until the patient was discharged, became ineligible for remdesivir initiation owing to elevated
ALT or AST values or an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m3, or initiated remdesivir. Because patients
with COVID-19 were often treated with both remdesivir and dexamethasone,20 we separated patient
days according to inpatient dexamethasone use on or before each day.We then estimated separate
logistic regression models to assess the likelihood of remdesivir treatment initiation on each hospital
day among patients stratified by dexamethasone treatment. Candidate variables for propensity
models were chosen based on literature review and clinical experience and included baseline
demographic characteristics, comorbidities, prior outpatient medication use, admission month, and
a series of time-dependent variables by hospital day, including laboratory values, vital signs, inpatient
medications, mechanical ventilation use, and ICU stay up to and including the hospital day at the time
of matching.
Each patient who initiated remdesivir treatment on a given hospital day was matched to a
similar patient who had not initiated remdesivir treatment by the same hospital day. The day of
matching was then defined as the index day for the outcome observation for both the remdesivir
recipient and the control individual. Control patients who initiated remdesivir treatment on a later
day during hospitalization were censored from follow-up at the time of remdesivir treatment
initiation. To evaluate the quality of matching, we calculated standardized differences between
characteristics of matched remdesivir recipients and controls as of the index day of matching, where
standardized differences less than 10% suggested good covariate balance.21We used Cox
proportional hazards regression models to estimate differences in treatment outcomes in the
matched cohort, censoring control patients who later initiated remdesivir treatment at the time of
initiation and all patients who had not died at 30 days. Models included a random effect for hospitals
and further controlled for residual differences in patient characteristics after matching (ie, age,
race/ethnicity, outpatient medications, comorbidity, vital signs, ICU status and mechanical ventilation
use on the day of matching, and the calendar day of matching).We report 2-sided P values using a
significance threshold of .05.
For analyses of time from matching to hospital discharge with death as a competing risk, we
generated cumulative incidence function plots for discharge among remdesivir recipients and
controls and estimated Fine-Gray subdistribution HRs for discharge.22 To explore potential
associations between completion of remdesivir treatment courses and time of hospital discharge,we
plotted days from matching to discharge among remdesivir recipients and controls as well as the
total number of days that remdesivir treatment was received in the hospital among remdesivir
recipients. These plots excluded patients who died before discharge. 
We describe our alternate approach to data analyses using marginal structural models in the
eMethods in the Supplement. In brief, we began with the entire study cohort and weighted the
contribution of each patient on a given hospital day using stabilized weights incorporating baseline
and time-varying patient covariates.18,19 Associations between remdesivir use and outcomes (ie, time
to mortality and hospital discharge) were then assessed using weighted pooled models (eMethods
in the Supplement).

Routine initiation of remdesivir in more severely ill patients is unlikely to be beneficial.; Next In this cohort study of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 at Veterans Affairs facilities,
remdesivir treatment was associated with prolonged hospitalization but was not associated with
improved survival. The finding of a longer time to hospital discharge in association with remdesivir
treatment represents a potential unintended and undesirable consequence of remdesivir adoption in
practice. If remdesivir use shortened time to recovery from COVID-19, as indicated by the ACTT-1,4 hospital stays could be shorter and more beds could become available to treat more patients during
COVID-19 surges. This would be a substantial benefit during a pandemic that is straining hospital
resources regardless of any association with mortality. As other researchers have noted
,23
the ACTT-1
excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours; thus, it was difficult to
extrapolate ACTT-1 study findings to length of hospital stay among patients treated with remdesivir
in routine practice. The current study suggests that remdesivir treatment was associated with an
increased time to hospital discharge as it was administered in routine clinical settings.",N/R,N/R,"Of 96 859 COVID-19 patients, 42 473 (43.9%) received at least 1 remdesivir dose.

variable timing of administration, we used time-dependent
propensity score (PS) matching to create pairs of individuals,

similar patient eligible for treatment at the time of remdesivir
initiation but who did not receive remdesivir. The PS was computed
using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression
model with the time from admission to the first dose of remdesivir being the outcome. Dexamethasone was included as a matching variable (see the Supplementary Data) [6, 23, 24]. In order to account for changes in the pandemic over time, an individual that received remdesivir prior to 1 October 2020 had to be matched to a control patient hospitalized before 1 October 2020 (Supplementary Figure 1). An additional time constraint was imposed such that a patient who received k days of treat
ment with remdesivir was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (up to a maximum of 5) beyond the matching day [6]. This condition avoids matching remdesivir patients to individuals who were healthy enough to be discharged soon after the matching day and would not have been considered candidates for remdesivir treatment.

Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not feasible in the
database.
2.  Only first admissions
occurring during the study period were included.
3. RDV patients were those administered with at least 1 dose
of RDV in the first 2 days of hospitalization, whereas non-RDV
users were those who were not administered RDV at any time
during hospitalization.","1. Only those patients from hospitals that reported charges for supplemental oxygen such as LFO for at least 1 patient were included in the NSO group
(defined as no supplemental oxygen charge in hospitals that demonstrably charge for supplemental oxygen). 
2. Patients were excluded from the study population for the following
criteria: pregnant; length of stay longer than 100 days
to reduce likelihood of hospitalization because of other health
conditions; incomplete data; transferred to or from another
hospital; transferred from a hospice; elective procedures; discharged
or died during baseline period. Patients who received
RDV through a clinical trial or who were first administered
RDV after the baseline period were also excluded. Figure 1 presents
the study consort diagram.","The outcomes were 14-day and 28-day all-cause inpatient mortality (defined as a discharge status of “expired” or “hospice”). Patients were followed after the baseline period (ie, from day 3 of admission) until death or end of study period. Patients who
were discharged alive and not into a hospice were censored at 14 and 28 days in the analyses.
Propensity score (PS) methods were used to match patients receiving RDV to those not receiving RDV. PS was estimated
using separate logistic regression models for NSO, LFO, highflow oxygen/noninvasive ventilation (HFO/NIV), and invasive
mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) groups at baseline. Variables included in
PS models were demographics (age group, sex, race, ethnicity, primary payor), key comorbidities, hospital characteristics, admission
from skilled nursing facility, admission month, hospital ward upon admission, other indicators of severity based
on admission diagnoses (such as hypoxemia, sepsis, respiratory failure, and pneumonia), and concomitant COVID-19 treatment
with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and convalescent plasma at baseline (Supplementary Table 1). All covariates were
retained in the model irrespective of their P value. Secondorder interaction terms were tested and retained in the model
only if they were statistically significant (P < .05).  To account for differences in hospital COVID-19 management
practices, a preferential within-hospital matching approach with replacement was used:
1. Patients receiving RDV were matched to non-RDV patients with same baseline severity in 2-month blocks of admission
(August–September, October–November) in the same hospital. 2. Unmatched patients in the RDV group were matched to non-
RDV patients with same baseline severity in 2-month blocks of admission (August–September, October–November) in
another RDV-using hospital of same bed-size category. In addition, up to 1:10 variable matching ratio was allowed (ie,
each RDV patient could be matched to at least 1 and at most 10 non-RDV patients) and the minimum difference between
the PS of patients from the 2 groups (ie, caliper distance) was defined as 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the
PS. The matching with replacement approach allowed for most RDV patients to be matched despite the restrictive matching
criteria. In addition, because there is likely to be considerable unmeasured confounding relating to the choice of treating perceived
mild cases upon hospital admission, all patients included in the analysis were required to have at least 3 days of hospital
stay from the time of index. This emulates previous study design approaches, including the ACTT-1 study [8, 23].

Mortality at 14 and 28 days was assessed using Kaplan-Meier
curves and compared using log-rank tests. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to derive hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
CI. Models were adjusted for hospital-level cluster effects and
the following covariates: age at admission, admission month,
treatment at baseline (anticoagulants, convalescent plasma, corticosteroids,
tocilizumab), hospital ward upon admission, and
any baseline covariate with an absolute standardized difference
of >0.15 in subgroups of patients receiving NSO, LFO, HFO/
NIV, and IMV/ECMO.",,,"Before matching, patients receiving RDV had
a mean age (standard deviation) of 64.2 (15.0) years of age, and
the plurality were white with Medicare as primary payor, with a
slight skew toward males.",,"Outcomes were 14-day and 28-day all-cause inpatient mortality

and 28 days in the analyses.",,,Premier Healthcare Database,,USA,"1. Actual dates and time stamps are not provided to ensure patient privacy; hence, all baseline variables are examined within first 2 days of
hospitalization.; next Most covariates had a standardized difference absolute value of <0.10 after matching, except primary payor (0.11), cardiovascular disease (0.11), renal disease (0.16), and age group (0.17)
2. However, the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 has been previously validated in the Premier Healthcare Database as a specificity of 99.04% and sensitivity of 98.01% [27]. Because
not all hospitals consistently bill for oxygen supply or devices, particularly LFO, it is possible that the group with no supplementary
oxygen (NSO) could include patients who received some level of oxygen that was not billed but instead subsumed in the room charge. To minimize this limitation and permit a clear classification of the NSO group, only those patients from hospitals that reported charges for supplemental oxygen such as LFO for at least 1 patient were included in the NSO group (defined as no supplemental oxygen charge in hospitals that demonstrably charge for supplemental oxygen). Only first admissions occurring during the study period were included.
3. To examine the impact of hospital-level effects, these effects were removed from all steps of the analyses as follows: (1) hospital
characteristics were excluded from PS calculation; (2) preferential within-hospital matching approach was not used; and
(3) Cox proportional hazards models did not include hospitallevel cluster effects. We also considered a stringent matching
criterion (1:1 preferential within-hospital matching without replacement with same baseline severity and admission month).
To assess the impact of statistical modeling approach, consistent with a number of other previous studies, logistic regression
models with hospital-level random effects were also used to assess 14- and 28-day mortality. Finally, to assess the impact of
requiring patients to remain in the hospital for at least 3 days following index, and to reflect the lack of timestamps for treatment
initiation, a sensitivity analysis was performed whereby patients were required to remain in the hospital for only 2 days
following index.","Premier

compared using the Pearson χ2 test for qualitative variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality

[20]. Our data did not confirm significant clinical improvement at 7, 10 and 14 days, similarly to the results
of Ader et al in the DisCoVeRy phase 3 trial [21]. This difference might be mainly the result of the well-known
difference between patient selection in randomized controlled trials and real-world data as well as the differ
ence
in the definition of clinical improvement. We created this new clinical improvement measure to compen
sate
the fact that discharge from COVID wards was strictly linked to time spent in hospital by the Hungarian
emergency regulations to decrease the spread of the virus by recovered but not virus free individuals.In our real-world observational study men, patients over the age of 75 years and multimorbid patients benefit

the most from RDV treatment. This is in sync with the results shown in the ACTT-1 clinical trial [1], which
identified the most benefit in non-Hispanic Caucasians and patients older than 65 years compared to patients
between 40 and 65 years; next The study limitations are the protocol change during third wave as all eligible patients got RDV, which could have
distorted the results even after propensity score matching; the change of discharge criteria in November 2020,
as patients with clinical and radiological improvement could go to home isolation without the previously need
ed
two negative consecutive PCR results within 48 hours, making length of stay calculation inconsistent during
our study; the inclusion of patients from only one hospital, as different protocols can influence the outcome; the
use of all-cause mortality as an outcome, as remdesivir supposedly only decrease COVID-19 associated mortal
ity.
Lastly a strong limiting factor for our subgroups analysis is the low number of patients presenting with spe

Follow-up time for individual patients was calculated from the start date of the treatment record until the outcome event date, 28 days after the start of treatment, start of a second treatment with neutralising monoclonal antibody or antiviral
agent, death, patient deregistration date, or the study end date (10 August 2022), whichever occurred first. The risk of admission to hospital or death from covid-19 within 28 days in the two drug groups in period 1 were compared with Cox proportional hazards models, with time since treatment as the time scale. The Cox models were stratified by Sustainability Transformation Partnerships areas to account for
geographic heterogeneity in baseline hazards, with sequential adjustment for other baseline covariates. Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; model 2 was also adjusted for the 10 high risk cohort categories; model 3 was further adjusted for ethnic group, index of multiple deprivation (five categories), vaccination status, and calendar week; and model 4 was further adjusted for body mass index category, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each Cox model. We then adopted the propensity score weighting method as an alternative approach to account for confounding bias.9 We used propensity score weighting to balance the distributions of relevant covariates between the two drug groups. The propensity score for each patient was defined as the conditional probability of being treated with sotrovimab, estimated with a binary logistic regression of the actual treatment allocation on relevant baseline covariates. The average treatment effect weighting scheme was then applied to the Cox model based on the estimated propensity scores. Balance check of baseline covariates after weighting was conducted with standardised mean differences between groups (with a threshold of <0.10 as the indicator of well balanced). Robust variance estimators were used in the weighted Cox models. Missing values for covariates were treated as separate categories in the main analyses. Similar analytical procedures were used for comparing risks of secondary outcomes between the
groups. We also explored whether the following factors could modify the observed comparative effectiveness: each high risk cohort, covid-19 vaccination status (≥3 v <3), body mass index categories (≥30 v <30), presence of diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases or chronic respiratory diseases, days between a positive test result and the start of treatment (<3 v 3-5 days), age group (<60 v ≥60 years), sex, and ethnic group (white v non-white). We tested effect modification by each of these variables by adding the corresponding interaction term between the variable and drug group
in the stratified Cox model. Sensitivity analyses based on the stratified Cox model were conducted to assess the robustness of the main findings, including: with complete case analysis or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations for missing values (given the assumption of missing
at random) instead of treating missing values as a separate category; with Cox models stratified by calendar week to account for potential temporal
heterogeneity in baseline hazards, with conventional adjustment for other covariates; also adjusting for time between a positive test result and the start of treatment, and time between date of last vaccination and start of treatment; also adjusting for rural-urban classification, and other comorbidities and factors
that might have influenced the clinician’s choice of
treatment through the patient’s ability to travel to
hospital for an infusion (dementia, autism, learning
disabilities, severe mental illness, residency in a care
home, or housebound status); with restricted cubic
splines for age to further control for potential nonlinear
age effect; excluding patients with treatment
records for both sotrovimab and molnupiravir, or
with treatment records for any other treatment (ie,
casirivimab, Paxlovid (combination of nirmatrelvir
and ritonavir), or remdesivir); excluding patients who
did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test record before
treatment or started treatment after five days since a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; creating a one day or
two day lag in the follow-up start date to account for
potential delays in drug administration (ie, start the
follow-up on the second or third day after the recorded
treatment date); applying a more strict definition of
death related to covid-19 which requires covid-19 to be
listed as the underlying cause of death; and conducting
a competing risk analysis with admission to hospital
or death from covid-19 and admission to hospital or
death from other causes within 28 days as competing
outcome events with the Fine-Gray subdistribution
hazard model. Finally, to assess whether the main
findings during period 1 when the omicron BA.1

COVID-19 death was defined per WHO classification as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or con- firmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease ( e.g., trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease ( e.g., cancer) and should be counted independently of preexisting conditions that are suspected of trig- gering a severe course of COVID-19.

Based on Colorado statewide data ( CDPHE, 2021 ), SARS-CoV-2 infections due to the Omicron variant made up at least 96% of overall cases by December 26, 2021. As an update on previously published work ( Aggarwal et al . , 2022 ), a second cohort was selected between Oc- tober 1, 2021, to December 11, 2021, when the Delta variant made up at least 99% of overall cases to be able to investigate poten- tial changes in sotrovimab effectiveness between the Delta and Omicron phases. All patients had at least 28 days of follow-up. Patients were identified by either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (by polymerase chain reaction or antigen) or by the date of mAb ad- ministration if the date of the SARS-CoV-2 positive test was miss- ing.","For our primary cohort, we excluded patients who received a medication order for any antiviral treatment except sotro- vimab within 10 days of the positive SARS-CoV-2 test (Supple- ment, Appendix Figure 1); thus, we included only patients who were untreated (N = 31,187) or who were treated with sotrovimab (N = 1683). We excluded patients who were missing both a positive SARS-CoV-2 test date and a mAb administration date (N = 605), those who were already in the hospital or who were hospitalized on the same day as the positive test (N = 2009), and if more than 10 days had elapsed between the SARS-CoV-2 test and mAb ad- ministration (N = 9). We did not exclude patients based on EUA eli- gibility due to the lack of consistently available comprehensive EHR data for all patients.","Omicron only analysis We used nearest-neighbor propensity matching with logistic regression to match patients with treatment status as the out- come. The propensity model included age, sex, race/ethnicity, in- surance status, obesity status, immunocompromised status, num- ber of other comorbid conditions, number of vaccinations, and week in the study (categorical) (Supplemental Methods). We re- moved 67 sotrovimab-treated patients who had missing covari- ate data and lost an additional 54 in the matching process. We assessed the achieved balance using a threshold of < 0.1 for the standardized mean differences and achieved a ratio of 2.38:1 (3663:1542) untreated to treated patients in the final cohort. Pa- tients missing a SARS-CoV-2 positive test date (56.9%) had their test date randomly imputed based on the distribution of observed time to mAb treatment, as previously done ( Aggarwal et al . , 2022 ).
We used Firth’s logistic regression to assess associations be- tween binary outcomes (28-day hospitalization, 28-day mortality, and 28-day ED visits) and treatment. Firth’s logistic regression (R package logistf V 1.24) addresses issues with low event rates and complete separation.( Heinze et al . , 2020 ) Each multivariable model included all variables of interest, as outlined in the previous sec- tion. We included cohort week as a continuous, linear term in all adjusted models and constructed cumulative incidence curves to visually assess the trend across time from SARS-CoV-2 positive date to 28-day hospitalization by treatment status. We also an- alyzed in-hospital secondary outcomes related to the severity of respiratory disease in a descriptive manner. We focused on five subgroup analyses of clinical interest: age ( < 65 years vs ≥65 years), immunocompromised status (binary and tri-level), number of comorbid conditions ( ≥2 vs < 2), number of vaccinations ( ≥3 vs < 3), and time of study in the Omicron phase (early vs late). We estimated the treatment effect for each sub- group using interaction models. We adjusted each model for all variables included in the primary model. We performed two sensitivity analyses (Supplement, Appendix Tables 6-9). We repeated the primary analysis, including only pa- tients for whom we could verify their EUA eligibility based on available EHR data. We also repeated the primary analysis using a different SARS-CoV-2 positive test date imputation method that imputed a 10-day difference from the observed mAb administra- tion date (the maximum difference allowed by the EUA).
Omicron and Delta analysis To compare the effect of sotrovimab treatment during Omicron- or Delta-predominant COVID-19 phases, we developed a second propensity-matched analysis cohort. First, to address imbalances in treatment cohorts due to mAb supply, sotrovimab-treated patients during the Omicron-predominant phase were nearest-neighbor propensity-matched to sotrovimab-treated patients in the Delta- predominant phase based on logistic regression with the variant as the outcome. Matching variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, obesity, immunocompromised status, number of comorbid con- ditions, number of vaccinations, and insurance status. Then we propensity-matched mAb-matched sotrovimab-treated patients to untreated patients stratified by variant using nearest-neighbor matching based on a logistic regression with treatment status as the outcome and the same covariates previously described. We fit Firth’s logistic regression models with all-cause 28-day hospitalization as the outcome. For the primary analysis, the model was stratified by variant and included all variables of interest. A second analysis combined both cohorts and added a treatment- variant interaction to the logistic regression model along with the adjustment variables. The second model allowed us to formally test if the effect of treatment differed statistically between the Delta and Omicron cohorts (Supplemental Methods).All statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Soft- ware (version 3.6.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) ( Team, 2020 ).",,,"Those treated were older (44.3% were aged ≥65 years vs 11.4% in untreated group), more likely to be obese (30.5% vs 16.5%), be immunocompromised at any severity level (40.5% vs 12.9%), or have one or more comorbid conditions (71.9% vs 37.6%).; Over- all, the age distribution was similar, with approximately 40% aged ≥65 years, 60% female, 80% Non-Hispanic White, and 50% with private/commercial insurance. Hypertension (49%) and pulmonary disease (35%) were the most common comorbid conditions.

for treatment, administered as a single dose, was not captured. Cox regression was chosen to account for censoring at 14 days after the

included in the regression model. Age was adjusted for by including
an age group and a linear term to account for residual confounding in
age groups.14A number of difficult-to-quantify time-varying factors
were considered likely to affect the probability of being admitted to a
hospital at different time points. These included, but were not limited
to, the level of bed-occupancy in a given hospital, the number of
healthcare workers available and social distancing behaviours of clinically
vulnerable people. To account for this, the models were stratified
by specimen week, allowing separate baseline hazard functions per

Results of stratified Cox regression showed that, after adjusting for demographic variables,
KRT modality and duration, high-risk cohort categories, vaccination status, calendar date, BMI category and other comorbidities, treatment with sotrovimab was associated with substantially lower risk of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death than treatment with
molnupiravir (hazard ratio, HR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.71; P=0.004). Consistent results favouring sotrovimab over molnupiravir were obtained from propensity score weighted Cox models (Model 4: HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.80; P=0.010), following confirmation of successful balance of baseline covariates between groups in the weighted sample (Supplementary Table 2).

records of both sotrovimab and molnupiravir were censored at the start date of the second
treatment (n=8). In the SRR cohort, as the data linkage was only undertaken looking at
sotrovimab or molnupiravir, we are unable to determine if any other antiviral treatments have
been given prior to this.","OpenSAFELY-UKRR cohort. Distributions of baseline characteristics were compared
between the two treatment groups. Follow-up time of individual patients was calculated from
the recorded treatment initiation date, until the outcome event date, 28 days after treatment
initiation, initiation of a second nMAb/antiviral treatment, death, patient deregistration date,
or the study end date (September 30, 2022), whichever occurred first.
Risks of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death were compared between the two
groups using Cox proportional hazards models, with time since treatment as the time scale.
The Cox models were stratified by NHS region to account for geographic heterogeneity in
baseline hazards, with sequential adjustment for other baseline covariates. Model 1 was
adjusted for age and sex; Model 2 additionally adjusted for high-risk cohort categories
(except Down syndrome, liver disease, HIV/AIDS and rare neurological conditions due to low
counts), KRT modality and years since KRT start date; Model 3 further adjusted for ethnicity,
IMD quintiles, vaccination status, calendar date (with restricted cubic splines to account for
non-linear effect); and Model 4 additionally adjusted for BMI category, diabetes,
hypertension, chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases. Missing values of covariates were
treated as separate categories to retain sample size. The proportional hazards assumption
was tested based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals.
As an alternative approach, we adopted the propensity score weighting (PSW) method to
account for confounding bias. The covariates were balanced between the two drug groups through the average treatment effect (ATE) weighting scheme based on the estimated
propensity scores. Balance check of baseline covariates after weighting was conducted
using standardised mean differences between groups (with threshold of <0.10 as the
indicator of well-balanced). Robust variance estimators were used in the weighted Cox
models.
Similar analytical procedures were used for secondary outcomes. In addition, we explored
whether the following factors could modify the observed comparative effectiveness: time
period with different dominant variants (December 16, 2021 to February 15, 2022 for BA.1,
February 16-May 31 for BA.2, June 1-August 1 for BA.4/BA.5),[21] KRT modality (dialysis or
kidney transplantation), BMI categories (≥30 vs. <30 kg/m2), presence of diabetes,
hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases or chronic respiratory diseases, days between test
positive and treatment initiation (<3 vs. 3-5 days), age group (<60 vs. ≥60 years), sex and
ethnicity (White vs. non-White). Effect modification by each covariate was tested by adding
the corresponding interaction term in the stratified Cox model.
Additional sensitivity analyses based on the stratified Cox models were conducted, including
(1) using complete case analysis or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations to deal with
missing values in covariates; (2) using Cox models with calendar date as the underlying time
scale to further account for temporal trends (and circulating variants); (3) additionally
adjusting for time between test positive and treatment initiation, and time between last
vaccination date and treatment initiation; (4) additionally adjusting for rural-urban
classification, and other comorbidities and factors that might have influenced clinician’s
choice of therapy through the patient’s ability to travel to hospital for an infusion (learning
disabilities, severe mental illness, care home residency or housebound status); (5) using
restricted cubic splines for age to further control for potential non-linear age effect; (6)
excluding patients with treatment records of both sotrovimab and molnupiravir, or with
treatment records of casirivimab/imdevimab, Paxlovid, or remdesivir; (7) excluding patients
who did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test record before treatment or initiated treatment
after 5 days since positive SARS-CoV-2 test; (8) creating a 1-day or 2-day lag in the
follow-up start date to account for potential delays in drug administration; (9) conducting a
cause-specific analysis for the 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death vs. other
hospitalisation/death.

there was no relevant covariate information.

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified patients not requiring hospitalization or new supplemental oxygen, yet at
high-risk of disease progression, in line with sotrovimab EUA eligibility criteria, using diagnosis codes during
the 2 years prior to their SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis date.",,"Matching
First, among treated and eligible controls, we further restricted to those who met at least one criterion for
sotrovimab use under the EUA [16]. We then used exact matching to account for observable baseline
differences between patients who received sotrovimab and untreated controls. Exact matching was implemented
for the following variables: SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis date for treated and controls within one week, vaccination
status (unvaccinated, vaccinated with a primary series (2 mRNA or a single Janssen) or primary series plus
booster), and Health & Human Services (HHS) region because the FDA de-authorized sotrovimab
dissemination by HHS region following the rise of Omicron BA.2 variant (Appendix Table 1). We exact
matched on certain underlying conditions: chronic kidney disease or renal disease, immunosuppressive disease,
or immunosuppressive treatment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (most prevalent chronic lung disease in
VA) or asthma, and cardiovascular disease or hypertension.
We included all the additional variables (Table 1) that were not included in the exact matching as
covariates in our survival analyses. Covariates were measured before the initiation of sotrovimab to avoid
adjustment for potential mediators. Indicator variables were generated to capture missing or unknown values for
any of the matching criteria to retain patients in the study. To assess the robustness of the matching, we
calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) and a difference of 10 or greater was used to identify imbalance
between treated and controls.
Censoring
We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to compare patients who received sotrovimab and
their matched untreated controls. Since outcomes were assessed for the 30-day period after index date, patients
were censored on the earliest of: May 4th, 2022 (earliest date to allow 30-day post-index observation period for
the last sotrovimab given in VA), disenrollment, death, or 30 days post-index.
Secondary Analyses
The FDA began to de-authorize sotrovimab on March 25th, 2022 [Appendix Table 1], shortly after BA.2
became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the U.S. Consequently, during this period of BA.2
predominance, we observed few sotrovimab administrations and fewer outcomes through April 2022. Similarly, we have a short Delta period (17 days) starting when sotrovimab became available at VA and ending when
Omicron BA.1 became predominant, resulting in a small number of primary outcomes. Since these periods were
both short, we included COVID-19 related- emergency room (ED) or urgent care (UC) visits as a surrogate for
persistent or severe COVID-19 for our effectiveness estimate of sotrovimab against either Delta or Omicron
BA.2 SARS-CoV-2 variants. The time to event was the index date to the first occurrence of the outcome of
interest (30-day hospitalization or ED visits or UC visits).

by demographic factors (sex, age, WIMD), clinical factors (vaccination, number of comorbidities, weighted CCI score, clinical

hazard model with treatment status (treated/untreated) as a timedependent covariate and adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbidities,
WIMD, and vaccination status. For those receiving treatment, treatment status was updated from untreated to treatedthe day after treatment if they remained in the risk set.

repeated the analysis not adjusting for confounders, adjusting for the CCI weighted score rather than the number of comorbidities, and
adjusting for the clinical subgroup instead of the number of comorbidities.

hospitalized patients included in the interim analysis were at
least 18 years of age with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients had oxygen saturation
(SpO2) of ≤94% on room air or required supplemental
oxygen, and all had radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates.; Study 5807 inclusion criteria were designed to align with
those of study 5773. Patients were 18 years of age or older
with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR. Patients
were hospitalized, with SpO2 of ≤94% on room air or required
supplemental oxygen, with radiographic evidence
of pulmonary infiltrates, and did not receive remdesivir.","Patients were excluded if they were receiving medications that may potentially treat COVID-19 (see Supplementary Digital Content 6) at entry, but some received these treatments during the study. Patients on mechanical ventilation at screening were excluded; however, 13 patients who required ventilation between screening and the start of remdesivir treatment were included.; Exclusion criteria were retroactively applied to study 5807
to ensure the 2 study populations were comparable. These exclusions were: veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on day 1; alanine transferase or aspartate transferase >5 times the upper limit of normal; creatinine clearance <50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula at day 1; and being pregnant or breastfeeding.","The planned sample size of study 5773 was 400 patients [7]. As
data for study 5807 were collected concurrently with study 5773
enrollment, and the remdesivir-cohort disease characteristics
were unknown, we originally planned to identify up to 2000
eligible patients in study 5807 to have a sufficient sample for
analyses based on propensity score. The full analysis set for the
comparison included all eligible patients enrolled from study
start to cutoff date in both studies, with their propensity scores
within the common support region of both treatment cohorts.
Included patients from study 5773 also had to receive at least 1
dose of remdesivir; additional exclusion criteria were retroactively
applied to study 5807 (as described above). Patients from
Italian sites in study 5773 were excluded, an a priori decision
based on lack of comparative patients in study 5807 and given
differences in mortality outcomes seen in Italy compared to
other sites (see Supplemental Digital Content 4 for rationale).
In study 5773 and study 5807, day 1 was defined as randomization
and hospital admission, respectively.
Because the 2 cohorts were from 2 different studies and were
not randomized, imbalance in baseline characteristics may
have existed that could confound the interpretation of a potential
treatment effect of remdesivir. To approximate a randomized
clinical trial and reduce selection bias, propensity score
methods that aim to make treated and untreated groups as comparable
as possible were used. The propensity score is defined
as the probability of treatment assignment conditional on the
observed baseline characteristics and was calculated using a logistic
regression model with treatment assignment (remdesivir vs no remdesivir) as the dependent variable and the following
observed baseline characteristics as the independent variables:
age, sex, race, region (US, Ex-US), obesity, medical history (yes
vs no for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma),
medications used to treat COVID-19, and baseline clinical
status (7-point ordinal scale).
As the study objective was to estimate the treatment effect of
remdesivir versus standard of care on the entire study population,
a weighted analysis was adopted over a matched approach
to minimize losses in sample size (and thus statistical power).
Under the average treatment effect framework, the stabilized
IPTW method was used after trimming the patients in either
cohort whose propensity scores fell out of the common support
region of the propensity score distribution. The sample created
using IPTW assumes that the distribution of baseline characteristics
is independent of treatment assignment in order to yield
the average treatment effect [11]. Balance was verified by assessing
various metrics including the absolute standardized differences
of the independent variables included in the model to
estimate the propensity score. Hydroxychloroquine was widely
used to treat COVID-19 in the United States starting in March
2020. Because hydroxychloroquine use was discouraged in study
5773, hydroxychloroquine use was not balanced between the 2
cohorts before weighting. The addition of hydroxychloroquine
to the IPTW resulted in further imbalance in other prognostic
factors, especially the baseline clinical status, which suggests
that the treatment decision of hydroxychloroquine was made
differently in the 2 cohorts. We performed the primary analysis
excluding hydroxychloroquine from the propensity score
and confirmed the robustness of the primary analysis with
a sensitivity analysis including hydroxychloroquine in the
propensity score.
The proportion of patients with recovery on day 14 was
analyzed through a multivariable logistic regression model
using IPTW weighted likelihood, including treatment group
as the independent variable and all the baseline factors in
the aforementioned propensity score calculation model as
covariates. Moreover, stepwise model selection was performed
with nonsignificant covariates removed from the final
weighted logistic regression model. Hydroxychloroquine was
included in both primary and sensitivity weighted logistic
regression models.
Secondary endpoints were analyzed in the same way as the
primary endpoint.
If an ongoing hospitalized patient (alive and not discharged)
or a patient discharged or transferred to hospice or another facility
had a missing clinical status at a visit, the last available
postbaseline clinical status before the visit with a missing value
was used for that visit. All other analyses were based on complete
cases analysis. SAS® Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA) was used.","To approximate a randomized clinical trial and reduce selection bias, propensity score methods that aim to make treated and untreated groups as comparable as possible were used.

Thus, patients were excluded from both studies if they had venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on day 1; alanine transferase or aspartate transferase >5 × upper limit of normal; creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula); or were pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients were excluded from prospective Study 5773 if they were receiving medication for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mechanical ventilation at screening; however, patients enrolled in retrospective Study 5807 were allowed to receive treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, excluding remdesivir.","Propensity score matching was used to form matched sets of
patients from treated and control populations with similar
propensity scores; no imputation was used in this analysis.
Propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression
model to determine the probability of treatment assignment
based on observed baseline characteristics as independent variables
and treatment assignment (remdesivir vs no remdesivir)
as the dependent variable. Baseline was defined as the start of
remdesivir therapy in prospective Study 5773 and the date of
hospitalization in retrospective Study 5807. Baseline factors included
in the propensity score model are summarized in Table
2. See Supplementary Methods for further information on the
propensity score matching. Recruitment for both studies was
conducted before the results of the RECOVERY trial [14] and
before the adoption of dexamethasone as part of standard of
care in the clinic; thus, data on corticosteroid use were not collected
in Study 5807.
For the primary analysis, recovery and mortality rates were
analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic
regression model including treatment as an independent
variable and matched sets as clusters [15]. Additional analyses
evaluated factors associated with day 28 mortality using a
multivariable GEE logistic regression model; covariates used in
the model are listed in Table 2.
A subgroup analysis of patients categorized according to oxygen
support status required at baseline (based on the 7-point
ordinal scale) was conducted. The patient subgroups included
those on invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow oxygen
(>6 L/min), low-flow oxygen (≤6 L/min), or room air (no supplemental
oxygen required). SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC) was used.",,,"After matching, a notable difference between remdesivir
and nonremdesivir cohorts was the receipt of medications

currently hospitalized, aged ≥18 years, (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection
confirmed by PCR test ≤4 days before trial enrollment, (3)
SpO2 ≤94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen at
screening, (4) presence of radiographic evidence of pulmonary
infiltrates.
Supportive Care Study Arm Patient Selection: 
After identifying those
patients and in an effort to minimize selection bias, we used
the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: (1) hospitalized
for at least 48 hours, (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by
PCR, (3) SpO2 ≤94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen within the first 48 hours of admission, (4) presence of
radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates","In addition, patients who met any of the following
clinical exclusion criteria were not considered eligible: (1) ALT
or AST >5 times of the upper normal limit (UNL), (2) creatinine
clearance <50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation,
(3) pregnant or breastfeeding.
Supportive Care Study Arm Patient Selection: In addition, patients
who met any of the following clinical exclusion criteria
were not considered eligible: (1) ALT or AST >5 times of the
upper normal limit (UNL) and (2) creatinine clearance (CrCl)
<50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.
Additional Exclusion Criteria
Patients from the remdesivir arm could have been enrolled
in the remdesivir trial during any day of their hospital stay,
as long as they met the predefined inclusion criteria. For the
purposes of this study, this could have been a potential source
of immortal time bias [11] because those patients should have
been alive at least until the day of remdesivir trial enrollment.
As a result, after defining the date of hospital admission as day
1 for both study arms, we included only patients who received
remdesivir within the first 48 hours of their admission, while
we excluded all patients who died within the first 48 hours from
both study arms.","For patients’ baseline characteristics, we represented continuous
measurements as means (SDs) or medians (IQRs), and
we compared them using the Student t test and the Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon test, respectively. For categorical data, we
used Pearson’s chi-square test.
For the primary study outcome, that is, the impact of
remdesivir use on in-hospital death, we utilized both univariate
and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. In the multivariate
model, we accounted for potential confounders associated
with COVID-19 mortality such as age, sex, race, chronic
comorbidities (heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic pulmonary
disease, obesity), use of systemic corticosteroids, and patients’
oxygen requirements on admission. Similar models were
implemented to assess the risk of developing AKI during the
28-day follow-up period. For all models, we assessed the proportional
hazards assumption using weighted Schoenfeld residuals.
To evaluate the secondary outcomes of time to clinical recovery,
time to clinical improvement, and time to discharge
(measured from the time of admission), we utilized a stratified
log-rank test and calculated the Mantel-Cox rate ratios.
We stratified based on oxygen requirements on admission (ie,
room air with spO2 <94%, low-flow oxygen, NIPPV or HFOD,
mechanical ventilation), age group (18–49, 50–64, ≥65 years),
race, sex, and date of symptom onset (<7 days, ≥7 days). If a
patient died before day 28, they were right-censored at day 28.
Outcomes of patients who were discharged to a hospice before
day 28 were censored at day of discharge.

5 = hospitalized requiring invasive mechanical ventilation orextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 6 = death. Similarly, clinical improvement was achieved when a patient
had a 2-point improvement on the aforementioned 6-point ordinal scale. Finally, using the KDIGO criteria, we assessed the
incidence of AKI in patients receiving remdesivir compared with patients receiving supportive care.

During this treatment period, there was relative clinical equipoise between Paxlovid and sotrovimab (both as first-line options in NHS England guideline) [2]. In addition, eligible patients in this study were required to be non-hospitalised for COVID-19 at treatment initiation (as recorded in COVID-19 therapeutics dataset [9]), and be registered in GP surgeries before treatment.; According to the eligibility criteria from NHS England [2], to have received an nMAb or antiviral treatment for COVID-19 in the community during this period, patients needed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or lateral flow test, onset of COVID-19 symptoms within the last five days, have no signs of recovery and not require hospitalisation for COVID-19 or supplemental oxygen specifically for the management of COVID-19 symptoms before treatment, and be a member of at least one of the following ten high-risk cohorts: patients with Down syndrome, a solid cancer, a haematological disease or stem cell transplant, renal disease, liver disease, immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, primary immune deficiencies, HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplant, or rare neurological conditions.","Patients were excluded if they had treatment records of any other antivirals or nMAbs for COVID-19 before receiving the treatment under investigation (n=76). Patients with treatment records of other antivirals or nMAbs after receiving the treatment under investigation were censored at the start date of the second treatment (n=31).; To be noted, there was caution about treatment with Paxlovid if patients had a history of advanced decompensated liver cirrhosis, stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (or stage 4-5 in the updated guideline), solid organ transplant, or were taking any of the medications with potential drug-drug interactions listed in the NHS England guideline [2]. Therefore, we detected and excluded all patients with these restrictions based on medication records (prescription of any contraindicated medications in “Drugs do not use” and “Drugs consider risks and benefits” codelists [11] within 180 days before treatment), diagnosis codes and clinical tests (eGFR or creatinine) in OpenSAFELY-TPP to ensure comparability between participants treated with Paxlovid and sotrovimab or molnupiravir (Figure 1).","For the comparative effectiveness analysis of Paxlovid vs. sotrovimab, distributions of baseline characteristics were compared between patients in these two treatment groups. Follow-up time of individual patients was calculated from the date of the treatment initiation record, until the date of outcome event, 28 days after treatment initiation, initiation of a second nMAb/antiviral treatment, death, patient de-registration date, or the study end date (December 22, 2022), whichever occurred first.
Risks of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death were compared between the two drug groups using Cox proportional hazards models, with time since treatment as the time scale. The Cox models were stratified by region to account for geographic heterogeneity in baseline hazards, with sequential adjustment for other baseline covariates. Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; Model 2 additionally adjusted for high-risk cohort categories (Down syndrome, solid cancer, haematological disease, immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, immunosuppression, rare neurological conditions); Model 3 further adjusted for ethnicity (White or non-White), IMD quintiles, vaccination status, calendar date (with restricted cubic splines to account for non-linear effect); and Model 4 additionally adjusted for BMI category (<25 kg/m2, 25 - <30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases. Missing values of covariates were treated as separate categories. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each Cox model.
As an alternative approach to account for confounding bias, we used the propensity score weighting (PSW) method to balance the distributions of relevant covariates between groups. The propensity score (PS) for each patient is defined as the conditional probability of being treated with Paxlovid, estimated with a binary logistic regression of the actual treatment on relevant baseline covariates. The average treatment effect (ATE) weighting scheme based on propensity scores (with and without trimming: approaches discussed further in results) [12,13]) was then applied to the Cox model. Balance check of baseline covariates after weighting was conducted using standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups. Robust variance estimators were used in the weighted Cox model. Similar analyses were conducted for secondary outcomes.
Further exploratory analyses were conducted by different subgroups, including time period with different dominant variants (February 11-May 31 for BA.2, June 1-October 1 for BA.5 [14]), each high-risk cohort, presence of obesity (≥30 vs. <30 kg/m2), diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases or chronic respiratory diseases, days between test positive and treatment initiation (<3 vs. 3-5 days), age group (<60 vs. ≥60 years), sex and ethnicity (White vs. non-White). Effect modification by each covariate was tested by adding the corresponding interaction term in the stratified Cox model, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
Several sensitivity analyses based on the stratified Cox model were conducted to assess the robustness of main findings, including (1) using complete-case analysis or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations to deal with missing values in covariates; (2) additionally adjusting for time between test positive and treatment initiation, and time between last vaccination date and treatment initiation; (3) additionally adjusting for rural-urban classification, and other comorbidities and factors that might have influenced clinician’s choice of therapy through the patient’s ability to travel to hospital for an infusion (learning disabilities, severe mental illness, care home residency or housebound status); (4) using restricted cubic splines for age to further control for potential non-linear age effect; (5) excluding patients with treatment records of both sotrovimab and Paxlovid, or any other treatments (i.e., casirivimab, molnupiravir, or remdesivir); (6) excluding patients who did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test record before treatment or initiated treatment after 5 days since positive SARS-CoV-2 test; (7) creating a 1-day or 2-day lag in the follow-up start date to account for potential delays in drug administration; (8) excluding those with prescription record of any contraindicative medication for Paxlovid within 1 year before treatment of Paxlovid of sotrovimab, or within 90 days before treatment of Paxlovid of sotrovimab; (9) not excluding those with contraindications or contraindicative medications for Paxlovid, adjusting for these conditions as covariates instead.
Finally, we adopted similar analytical approaches for the exploratory analysis comparing Paxlovid users with molnupiravir users.

crossover to remdesivir in the control group and differential censoring, the focus of this article is on
the more conservative initial-treatment analysis. Patients were censored on the earliest occurrence
of discharge or maximum follow-up of 28 days. Cause-specific hazards models were applied to the
PS-matched cohort to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CIs of remdesivir compared with control
patients (α = .05). No covariates were included in the models as these were well adjusted in the RSS

26, 2022 and July 20, 2022 (N=23,191). Specifically, we selected all outpatient molnupiravir
recipients aged 65 years or older (N= 4,240) corresponding to 65.5% of the total number of
patients on molnupiravir and 13,861 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients accounting for 59.8% of
the total population treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. We selected only the age group ≥ 65
years old, since co-morbidities were unknown among the non-recipients (controls). Given
that co-morbidities increase with age, age-matched controls are very likely to have a similar
pattern of co-morbidities as the antiviral recipients.; Patients were eligible if they had
a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), or rapid antigen test (RAT), and had risk

molnupiravir and 13,861 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.",,"Continuous variables were described using median and interquartile range (IQR), and
for categorical variables frequencies and percentages were used. Factors associated with
different outcomes (hospital admission, or covid-19 death, or the combined outcome related
to hospital admission, including ICU admission/intubation, or death) were estimated by
multivariable logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used
to identify each drug’s relative risk (odds ratio, OR) for symptomatic disease or death or the
combined outcome, for patients on treatment versus the controls adjusted for age, previous
SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination status, and time from vaccination. The relative
effectiveness of the antivirals was estimated for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus molnupiravir
recipients adjusted for age, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination status, recency of
vaccination and co-morbidities (i.e. obesity, BMI >=35; cardiovascular disease, diabetes
mellitus, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease).
Specifically, the number of comorbidities was included in the model as a four-level
independent variable (i.e., one, two, three, or more than three) after the exclusion of
individuals with moderate or severe immunodeficiency. The effect of treatment adherence in
treatment effectiveness was investigated for molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients
by comparing patients with complete versus poor or incomplete adherence, adjusted for age,
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination status, and recency of vaccination.
The drug’s effectiveness was estimated using the reverse of the OR for symptomatic
disease or death or the combined outcome for those on molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir

4,240 eligible molnupiravir recipients undertaken in outpatient services and 4,240 nonrecipients

eligible nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients and 13,861 matched non-recipients. The
characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Similarly, to patients treated
with molnupiravir, most of the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients had an age ≥ 80 years (37.5%)
and were vaccinated with the primary scheme (90.2%) (Table 1). Specifically, 68.1% and
16.6% had received one and two booster doses, respectively; proportions similar to the
corresponding ones among the non-recipients (Table 1). Contrary to patients on molnupiravir,
those on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had received the first booster shot earlier, and, therefore, most
of the cases receiving a single booster dose had been vaccinated for more than 6 months

In this analysis, only patients on treatment were included. Statistical analysis revealed that patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had a lower relative risk for symptomatic disease compared to those on molnupiravir (OR = 0.58, p < 0.001), adjusted for age, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination status, and co-morbidities (model 1, Table 7). As in the previous models, vaccination and previous infection reduced the relative risk for hospitalization, while the increasing age and the number of co-morbidities had the opposite effect (model 1, Table 7). The risk for hospital admission increased with the number of comorbidities and specifically patients with two or more comorbidities had a higher risk for hospitalization (model 1, Table 7) compared to those without comorbidities. Comorbidities were associated with a higher risk for hospitalization only in the elderly group of patients (model 6, Table 7). For the age group 65-79 years old, comorbidities were excluded from final analysis since there was no association with the outcome (Table 7). A lower relative risk for death for those on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was marginally not significant (OR = 0.69, p = 0.09) (model 2, Table 7). A similar effect was found for vaccination, comorbidities, and age, while no significant effect was observed for previous infection. Notably, in the subsequent analyses on specific age groups, the difference in the effectiveness between the two drugs was significant and more pronounced in younger ages (age group 65-69: OR = 0.30, p = 0.002; age group 70-74: OR = 0.39, p = 0.003; ≥80 years old: OR = 0.69, p = 0.03) (models 3, 4, and 6 Table 5).

0·05 to be statistically significant without adjustment
for multiple comparisons. Firth’s logistic regression
(R package logistf version 1.24) addresses estimation
issues related to low event rates and complete separation.23–25 All models were adjusted for age, sex,
race and ethnicity, insurance status, obesity status,
immunocompromised status, number of additional
comorbid conditions, number of vaccinations, and
omicron subvariant. We fit cumulative incidence plots to
estimate the time from SARS-CoV-2 positive test to allcause
hospitalisation and all-cause emergency department
visits. Care should be used in interpreting these
curves because of the frequent use of rapid antigen home
testing before a health-care encounter for an electronic
health record-tracked SARS-CoV-2 test result or
treatment. For the 28-day hospitalisation secondary
outcomes, we fit an adjusted logistic regression to assess
the association between treatment and the odds of being
transferred to the intensive care unit. Additionally, to
evaluate the difference in hospital length of stay, we fit an
adjusted negative binomial regression and reported
adjusted incidence risk ratios (RRs) to account for
overdispersion in the outcome. A likelihood ratio test
was done to compare the adjusted Poisson model to the
adjusted negative binomial model, and a test of
overdispersion found estimated dispersion in the
Poisson model was 5·6 (p<0·0001).26 Because of the
small number of hospitalised participants, we present
only descriptive statistics for respiratory disease severity
and intensive care unit length of stay.
We estimated adjusted treatment effects for eight
subgroups of interest by fitting interaction models that
were also adjusted for all variables of interest. The
subgroups of interest included binary age (<65 years vs
≥65 years), binary obesity status (not obese vs obese),
and three-level immunocompromised status (not
immunocompromised
vs mild immunocompromised
vs moderate–severe immunocompromised), binary
number of comorbidities
(0–1 vs ≥2), binary vaccination
status (0–2 vs ≥3), three-level vaccination status (0 vs 1–2
vs ≥3), and omicron subvariant period (before BA.4 and
BA.5 and during BA.4 and BA.5).
We did several sensitivity analyses that repeated the
primary analysis using different assumptions with
subsequent propensity matching. For the first sensitivity
analysis, we only selected patients with electronic health
record-derived data on emergency use authorisationqualifying
conditions (appendix 1 pp 14–16). We
implemented a second method of determining SARSCoV-
2 positive date for patients treated with nirmatrelvir–
ritonavir by imputing a 3-day difference between
treatment
initiation and assumed SARS-CoV-2 positive
date to account for a fixed delay (eg, over a weekend)
between a home test positive result and prescribed
treatment (appendix 1 pp 17–20). Additionally, we did
four post-hoc sensitivity analyses. First, because
nirmatrelvir–ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with
severe renal or liver dysfunction, patients who are more
well in general might be treated with nirmatrelvir–
ritonavir, potentially biasing in favour of a beneficial
treatment effect. We removed patients with renal disease and severe liver disease (appendix 1 pp 20–21). As there
was a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 test date
missingness among patients treated with nirmatrelvir–
ritonavir, we also did a sensitivity analysis of only those
with an observed test date (appendix 1 pp 21–23). As a
test to the assumption that patients who were hospitalised
on the same day as a positive test or nirmatrelvir–
ritonavir order had time to receive benefit from the
treatment, we did an analysis that excluded those who were hospitalised on the same calendar day as a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test or nirmatrelvir–ritonavir order
(appendix 1 pp 23–25). Finally, we evaluated the primary
cohort using a 1:1 propensity matching ratio that reduced
the potential for bias (appendix 1 pp 25–26).16
All statistical analyses were done using R Statistical
Software (version 3.6.0).","We propensity score matched patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with untreated patients; achieved a matching ratio of 1·31:1 treated to untreated patients, with a total matched cohort size of 16 529, consistent with the approach recommended by Austin to optimise precision while minimising bias.18 The propensity model included binary age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), sex, binary race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs other race or ethnicity), insurance status, immunocompromised status, obesity status, number of comorbid conditions other than immunocompromised status and obesity, number of vaccinations at the time of infection, and categorical week of SARS-CoV-2 positive test date.;

We used Firth's logistic regression to assess the association between treatment and 28-day hospitalisation, 28-day mortality, and 28-day emergency department visits, and we considered a two-sided p value of less than 0·05 to be statistically significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Electronic heath record evidence of comorbid conditions (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and liver disease) was based on the Charlson and Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices, and immunocompromised status was coded as reported previously (appendix 1 p 10).14 The number of comorbid conditions was calculated as the sum of these specific conditions, with obesity and immunocompromised status kept as separate comorbid conditions in the analysis. Vaccination status was further categorised by the number of vaccinations (none, one, two, or three or more) administered before the observed or imputed SARS-CoV-2 positive test date. Based on statewide virus strain data, we considered patients with an observed or imputed SARS-CoV-2 positive test on or after June 19, 2022, to be in the omicron BA.4 or BA.5 period, given that the statewide proportion of BA.4 or BA.5 was above 50% by that date, and rose to above 90% by July 10, 2022","with baseline characteristics showing

nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in a matched cohort framework, in
which we monitored participants from their index test to
the occurrence of each study endpoint or censoring (at the
scheduled end of follow-up, study end, or disenrolment
from the KPSC health system). We updated participants’
treatment assignments on the date of treatment
dispensing. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios and
associated 95% CIs for comparisons of outcomes among
people who received nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and those who
did not receive nirmatrelvir–ritonavir via Cox proportional
hazards models. We defined cluster-robust SEs to account for multiple observations from people whose treatment
status changed during follow-up. We verified the
proportional hazards assumption by testing for non-zero
slopes of Schoenfeld residuals.21 Additional details on
the regression framework are presented in the
appendix (p 2). For each endpoint, we then used these
adjusted hazard ratios to calculate the treatment
effectiveness
of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir as: Treatment
effectiveness = (1 – adjusted hazard ratio) × 100%. To
mitigate confounding driven by factors associated with
the likelihood of both receiving nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and
experiencing severe clinical outcomes, we constructed a
directed acyclic graph identifying a minimal set of
covariates for statistical adjustment (appendix p 24). We
defined regression strata (matches) among people with
COVID-19 on the basis of their week of SARS-CoV-2
testing, age, sex, timing of symptom onset in relation to
testing, health-care use during the previous year, number
of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, presence of
comorbidities, and BMI (appendix p 2). We measured
clinical status according to two criteria: receipt of care at
an appointment on or within 1 day before a positive SARSCoV-
2 test (across emergency department, urgent care,
outpatient, and virtual appointment
settings, excluding
other informal telephone encounters), and days from
symptom onset, or absence of acute symptoms, at the
start of the observation period. Because prescribing
guidelines assign differing priority to people with one or
more risk factors (eg, age, obesity, comorbidity, being
unvaccinated or undervaccinated),1 and interactions are
present in the effects of these risk factors on the likelihood
of developing severe disease,22,23 this approach was selected
to allow for differing baseline hazards across all
combinations of the listed covariates. Other variables were
included as model covariates for adjustment (appendix
p 2). We populated missing data for smoking status, BMI,
and neighbourhood deprivation index via multiple
imputation, pooling parameter estimates across analyses

We repeated analyses in subgroups who received at
least two or at least three COVID-19 vaccine doses, and
among individuals who met criteria for receipt of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir because they were at high risk of
COVID-19 progression as defined in US Emergency
Use Authorization guidelines.25 To understand the
potential association of the timing of treatment
initiation with clinical outcomes, we did exploratory
analyses within subgroups, including people treated
0–3 days after symptom onset (the primary exposure
assessed in the EPIC-HR trial3), people treated 6 or
more days after symptom onset or in the absence of
documented acute COVID-19 symptoms, and people
treated at any time after symptom onset. As an
additional exploratory analysis intended to emulate the
design of the EPIC-HR trial, in which people with
COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive
nirmatrelvir–ritonavir or placebo at the point of testing,
we distinguished courses dispensed on the day of
testing by censoring observations from people who
received treatment at later timepoints. We did all
analyses in R (version 4.2.1).",,"matching cases by date, age, sex, clinical status (including care received, the presence or absence of acute COVID-19 symptoms at testing, and time from symptom onset to testing), vaccination history, comorbidities, health-care seeking during the previous year, and BMI; Data for acute symptoms associated with COVID-19 were extracted from structured questionnaires given with each SARS-CoV-2 test order, and from unstructured text fields within electronic health records as described previously.17 Timing of symptom onset was defined as the earliest date on which people reported acute fever, cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnoea, chills, sore throat, myalgia, anosmia, diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea, or abdominal pain within 14 days before or after their index test date. Additional variables recorded at the time of index test included age, sex, race and ethnicity, BMI, current or former smoking status, socioeconomic status (measured by census-tract neighbourhood deprivation index18 quintiles), number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, comorbidities (from which we computed Charlson comorbidity index values19), health-care use in the previous year (including encounters across outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings), and receipt of other vaccines

ritonavir between 15 March and 15 October 2022 in
community pharmacies. As of today, Quebec outpatients eligible
for treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are those with severe
immunosuppression (regardless of their vaccination status),
as well as those without a complete primary vaccination course
who are aged 60 and over or who are aged 18 and over and
have at least 1 risk factor for severe COVID-19. Outpatients
with a complete primary vaccination course who are at high risk
of severe COVID-19 are also eligible for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir
on a case-by-case basis, as judged by a clinician [5].
The control group included outpatients who tested positive for
COVID-19 (RT-PCR test) between 15 March and 15 October
2022, but who did not receive a prescription of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir
during the study period. For the control group with several
positive RT-PCR tests during this period, only the first positive test
date was considered. All included outpatients were followed until
14 November 2022. The index date was the start date of the followup
period and was defined as the date of the first prescription of
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the treatment group, or as the date of
the COVID-19–positive test for the control group.","Individuals with less than 30 days of follow-up were excluded. Patients already hospitalized at the time of the COVID-19 positive test were excluded. Patients living in long-term care facilities were also excluded, because they are likely to be treated in long-term care facilities and this information was not available in the databases","Descriptive statistics were used to describe the treatment group
and hospitalized cases. For the purposes of regression analyses,
individuals with missing data were excluded, as they represent a
small number (1.7%). Treated outpatients were matched to controls using 1-to-1
nearest-neighbor propensity score matching without replacement
with a caliper of 10−5 (caliper of 10−2 was used to optimize number
of matched outpatients for analysis among severely immunocompromised
individuals). Propensity score was calculated
through a logistic regression with the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription
as the dependent variable (yes/no) and independent variables
were those listed in Table 1. The relative risk (RR) of
hospitalization in the treatment group compared with the control
group was estimated using a multivariable Poisson regression with
robust error variance [7], which included the variables used for the
propensity score to further minimize the confounding bias. The
same method was repeated for each subgroup analysis (according
to the vaccination status, age [<70 years and ≥70 years], and
among individuals with severe immunosuppression).
Using raw data on hospitalization, we calculated the number
needed to treat (NNT) with a 95% confidence interval (CI),
when relevant, according to the following formula [8]:
NNT=1 /(PEER × [1 􀀀 R])
where PEER=patientexpectedeventrate Sensitivity analyses were conducted afterwards to confirm findings,
and results are provided in Supplementary Appendix C
and D. These analyses comprised a multivariable regression including
overall individuals (not only matched individuals) and
analysis considering only hospitalizations for which the main
cause of admission was COVID-19 as the outcome, as well as
another analysis considering both COVID-19–associated hospitalization
and death as the outcome. Analyses were performed
using Stata/SE 15.1 for Windows (StataCorp LLC).","The treatment group was matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:1. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization among the treatment group compared to the control group.;

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population that received at least one prescription for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and to characterize the proportion of cases hospitalized within 30 days of the date of the first prescription for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. For the purposes of regression analyses, individuals with missing data were excluded, as they represent a small number.

The relative risk of hospitalization in the treatment group compared to the control group was estimated using a Poisson regression with robust error variance. This modified Poisson regression procedure is more reliable than binomial regression and at least as flexible and powerful 7. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce confounding and to ensure that the treatment group and the control group were comparable. Propensity score was performed through a logistic regression with the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescription as the dependent variable (Yes/No) and the confounding variables as independent variables (age, sex, region of residence, number of vaccine doses, time since the last vaccine dose, COVID-19 epidemic waves, number of health conditions, respiratory and cardiovascular condition, immunosuppression condition, cancer condition). Each individual from the treatment group was then matched to an individual in the control group using the one-to-one nearest neighbour matching method with a calliper of 10−5. The calliper was reduced to 10−2 for severely immunocompromised individuals to obtain sufficient matches and to increase statistical power for the regression model. The matching was carried out without replacement, i.e., each individual from the control group was used once to be matched with one individual in the treatment group. Poisson regression with robust error variance was then used to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization in the treatment group compared to the control group. Confounding variables used in the propensity score were included again in the final regression model to further minimize the differences between the matched groups. Propensity score matching was repeated for each subgroup analysis. Subgroups analyses included analysis in individuals without complete primary vaccination course, with complete primary vaccination course (overall), according to age (less than 70 years and 70 years and older), and with severe immunosuppression.

Using raw data on hospitalization, we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) with a 95% confidence interval, when relevant. This calculation was made for all individuals. The relative risk of occurrence of the event was calculated for each population and the NNT was then calculated according to the following formula 8:
Embedded Image
A sensitivity analysis with multivariable regression including overall individuals (not only matches individuals) was also performed to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization (significance threshold used: P-value < .05). Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering only hospitalizations for which the main cause of admission was COVID-19 as the outcome, as well as another sensitivity analysis considering both COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death as the outcome. Analyses were performed using Stata/SE 15.1 for Windows (StataCorp LLC).","Variables were determined or calculated at the index date and comprised socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19 data, and health conditions. The sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, and regions of residence. COVID-19 data included vaccination status (with complete primary vaccination course or without complete primary vaccination course), number of vaccine doses, time since the last vaccine dose, and COVID-19 epidemic waves. The first dose is considered effective 14 days after administration, whereas subsequent doses (two doses or more) are considered effective after 7 days. Individuals with a complete primary vaccination course included those who received at least two vaccine doses (as opposed to individuals who received no vaccine or only one vaccine dose). This definition of complete primary vaccination (2 doses) was also applied to severely immunocompromised individuals. Time since the last dose of the vaccine was categorized into less than 3 months, 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, 9 to 12 months, and more than 12 months. Individuals with a complete primary vaccination course were divided into 2 groups according to the time since the last vaccine dose: less than 6 months (≤ 182 days) and more than 6 months (>182 days).

Health conditions were identified through Population Grouping Methodology (POP Grouper), developed by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) 6.The POP Grouper is a methodology that uses a case-mix classification to profile each person in the population using clinical information (ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes) in the past three years. This algorithm identifies 226 health conditions. The number of health conditions (0, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19 and 20 or more) and types of health conditions (respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, immunosuppression conditions and cancer conditions) were considered in this analysis. Details on diagnosis included in each type of health condition were provided in Appendix D.

For the purposes of subgroup analysis of individuals at higher risk of COVID-19-related complications, those with severe immunosuppression were identified. Severe immunosuppression was defined as receiving high-dose immunosuppressive drugs (immunosuppressive drugs in solid organ transplants, anti-cell B therapy, alkylating agents, systemic corticosteroids) with a treatment duration which encompassed the index date or having received a haematological cancer diagnosis (leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) in the 12 months prior to the index date. Details about severe immunosuppression are provided in Appendix D.",,,"The outcome was COVID-19–associated hospitalization in the

people, aged 18 years or older, with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong, during
the omicron wave.; Patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from
Feb 26 to June 26, 2022, were eligible. Molnupiravir was
locally available for prescription from Feb 26, 2022, and
nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir from March 16, 2022. According
to clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 from the
Hong Kong Hospital Authority (appendix 2 p 11),14 patients
who (1) had mild symptoms, (2) were at risk of progressing
to severe disease (ie, with diabetes, obesity with bodymass
index ≥30 kg/m², aged ≥60 years, in an immunocompromised
state, with underlying chronic illnesses, or
not fully vaccinated), and (3) at early stage of disease
(within 5 days of symptom onset) were recommended to
receive molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir. Later
versions (since March 21, 2022, well after the wave peak)
of the guidelines also added that nirmatrelvir plus
ritonavir should be preferentially administered over
molnupiravir, unless the patient was on any concomitant
medications
contraindicated for nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir.","Excluded patients who were younger than 18 years, admitted to hospital before the SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis, dead on or before the SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis, or residents in residential care homes for the elderly.

We also excluded those who were initiated on oral antivirals more than 5 days since symptom onset from the analysis.","In the retrospective cohort design, we used propensityscore
models conditional on age, sex, date of confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and
vaccination status in a logistic regression model. We
used propensity-score matching without replacement
using a caliper width of 0·05. We calculated standardised
mean differences (SMDs) of each covariate between the
groups before and after the propensity-score matching,
which was interpreted as balanced when the SMD was
below the threshold of 0·1.16 Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of each outcome between oral antiviral users
and their respective matched non-users were estimated
using Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses
assessed the associations by vaccination status (fully
vaccinated vs not fully vaccinated) and age groups
(≤60 years vs >60 years). We assessed interactions between oral antiviral drug treatment and subgroups. In
the case-control design as sensitivity analysis, we used
conditional logistic regression to examine the association
of receiving oral antiviral drug treatment with
hospitalisation and all-cause mortality among patients
with COVID-19. We estimated odds ratios in molnupiravir
users and nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir users compared with
non-users. We did post-hoc sensitivity analyses of treating
oral antiviral use as a time-varying covariate in the Cox
regression models, and which split the observation times
for those in the oral antiviral group into two periods, an
earlier one from the index date to the day before the antiviral treatment initiation, and a later one from the date
of antiviral treatment initiation to the outcome occurrence,
crossover of oral antiviral treatment, or the end of the
observational period. All statistical analyses were done
using Stata/MP (version 17). All significance tests were
two-tailed, and a p value of less than 0·05 was considered
statistically significant.",,,"After matching,
patient characteristics were balanced between oral antiviral
and control groups at baseline, with all SMDs below 0·1,
except for age in the molnupiravir and matched control
groups (SMD=0·12; table 1). The distribution of propensity
scores in oral antiviral and matched control groups were
highly overlapping, indicating an acceptable quality of
matching for our propensity-score models (appendix 2 p 12).
Overall, fewer than half of the cohort had been fully
vaccinated, and most patients were older than 60 years
(table 1). Among those who were fully vaccinated, the last
dose of vaccination for molnupiravir users was received
1·68 months before baseline and 2·01 months before
baseline for matched controls. For nirmatrelvir plus
ritonavir users, the last dose was received 2·19 months
before baseline and 2·25 months before baseline for
matched controls. Patients with COVID-19 who were prescribed molnupiravir were older, with more pre-existing
comorbidities, and less likely to be fully vaccinated,
compared with those on nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir
(appendix 2 p 2). At baseline, 176 (3·5%) of 4983 molnupiravir
users and 76 (1·4%) of 5542 nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir

Additionally, since we were interested in quantifying the causal effect of Paxlovid treatment on

hospitalized on or before the COVID-19 index date or date of treatment with Paxlovid (outcome
precluding treatment), 2) patients who received Paxlovid before their COVID-19 index date, and
3) patients who received Paxlovid after the recommended five days following their COVID-19
index date. In order to ensure that data were captured from sites with high fidelity and adequate
340 coverage, we only included data from sites with at least 1% of eligible patients, and a minimum of
100 patients, treated with Paxlovid during the study period.","First, we applied a two-sided Chi-squared test to examine the distribution of Paxlovid treatment
across two covariates: 1) patient race/ethnicity, and 2) a ZIP Code-level Community Wellbeing
Index (hereafter referred to as CWBI). The CWBI measure is a composite index of social determinants
of health available within the N3C database, with higher CWBI values corresponding to a higher level of protective community-level social determinants of health. The index methodology
was developed by Sharecare and the Boston University School of Public Health. CWBI values are
derived from the patient’s residential ZIP Code-level data across five key inter-related communitylevel
domains: healthcare access (ratios of healthcare providers to population), resource access
(libraries and religious institutions, employment, and grocery stores), food access (access to grocery stores and produce), housing and transportation (home values, ratio of home value to income,
and public transit use), and economic security (rates of employment, labor force participation,
health insurance coverage rate, and household income above the poverty level).32
Next, we used a potential outcomes framework to compare the rate of hospitalization among
patients who received Paxlovid during the five days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test to those
who 375 did not. To adjust for confounding and emulate random assignment in the context of the
target trial, we matched individuals in the treatment and control cohorts on a set of pre-treatment
variables: sex, age (binned), race and ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) value (as a
proxy for all underlying medical conditions; binned), CWBI (binned), month of COVID-19 onset,
and site of care provision, including all data present in their electronic health record as of their
380 positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Due to the prevalence of literature suggesting disparity in treatment
assignment and outcomes by race, ethnicity, and other social determinants of health, we include
these measures as potential confounders.7–10 Sex, age, and comorbidities are known to affect both
care seeking for and the outcome of COVID-19. The index month was included because Paxlovid
treatment rates, viral variants, and infection rates changed during the study period. CCI was coded
385 as missing when no condition exposures were present in N3C prior to index. CWBI was coded as
missing when patient ZIP Code was not reported.
We matched patients in the treatment and control groups using coarsened exact matching
(CEM) and weighted observations by their CEM weights. CEM weights were defined as: See publication for entirety of analysis.",,,"Patients were matched
across treatment groups by characteristics selected a priori associated with the treatment assignment

FDA Paxlovid Patient Eligibility Screening Checklist5. The date of eligible patients’ positive
COVID-19 test or diagnosis was used as their trial entry date. The treatment group were those patients who initiated Paxlovid treatment within 5 days, with the remainder assigned to the
control group.; Our base cohort were adults (≥ 18 years old) with a COVID-19 index date between December
22, 2021 through February 28, 2023 who were eligible to receive Paxlovid treatment in
accordance with criteria adapted from FDA guidance. COVID-19 index was defined as the
earliest positive PCR or antigen test and/or COVID-19 diagnosis. A flowchart of cohort
construction is displayed in Figure 1A. There were 2,572,279 patients with a COVID-19 index
date in our followup period. A total of 2,490,027 patients were identified as having mild
COVID-19, meaning no hospitalization or emergency department visit within 3 days of
diagnosis. Of these, 1,584,635 patients were at risk for severe COVID-19, defined as the
presence of one or more underlying medical factors associated with greater risk of severe
COVID-1915 (see Supplement).","We excluded 254,839 patients with contraindications for
Paxlovid utilization. Contraindications for Paxlovid utilization were recorded use of any one of 37
strictly contraindicated medications (including rivaroxaban and salmeterol) within 180 days prior
to index, severe renal impairment, or hepatic impairment. Severe renal impairment was defined
as eGFR values < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 within 30 days prior to index date or record of Stage 4
chronic kidney disease in the prior 180 days. Severe hepatic impairment was defined as
Child-Pugh Class C or record of severe liver disease 180 days prior to index. In total, there were
1,329,796 Paxlovid-eligible patients per study criteria. Prior to modeling, we excluded 206,213
patients with missing ZIP codes and 517 patients with missing area-level or gender data. Furthermore, we excluded 81,484 patients for hospitalization within 6 months prior to index
date, and 28,672 patients without any history of healthcare in the EHR prior to index date,
leaving a total of 1,012,910 in the main analyses (see Figure 1).","We first described Paxlovid uptake over time and location in the US. To represent geographic
distribution of uptake across three time periods we mapped the proportion of Paxlovid-eligible
patients receiving treatment. To calculate uptake in 2-digit ZIP code regions, the numbers of
eligible and treated-eligible patients were aggregated by the first two digits of their recorded ZIP
code. To understand predictors of Paxlovid uptake, we fit a logistic regression model predicting
Paxlovid use from baseline covariates on the subcohort of eligible patients. Because the
proportion of treated and untreated patients was imbalanced (i.e., 9.7% treated), groups were
reweighted by the inverse of the proportion in each group. One of the covariates (body mass
index [BMI]) had over 30% missing values, which we imputed using IterativeImputer from the
Scikit-learn package (v0.21) in Python with 25 imputations. We then calculated Shapley values
to understand the most important, unique predictors of Paxlovid use using the Python Shap
package (v0.41.0). The Shapley value quantifies the average change in predicted Paxlovid use
when a variable is present versus absent across models with varying covariates16.
To estimate the relative risk (RR) of hospitalization and mortality in treated and untreated
patients, we used a target trial emulation framework with IPTW13. We first fit a propensity model
using logistic regression predicting exposure to Paxlovid from the baseline covariates and
health care institution, with weights generated from model probabilities to estimate the Average
Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT)17,18. Balance on pretreatment covariates was assessed
via absolute standardized mean differences (see eFigure 1 in the Supplement). To estimate the
RR of hospitalization, we used the R package cmprskcoxms (v0.2.1) to fit an IPT-weighted
cause-specific hazard model treating death as a competing event19, and used the estimated
cumulative incidence functions (CIF) to calculate RR of hospitalization by 28 days between
treated and untreated patients. Confidence intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) were
generated using 100 bootstrapped samples20. RR of mortality was obtained from weighted
Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curves at 28 days, with confidence intervals generated as
above using the Lifelines package (v0.27.7) in Python20.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of our results to various assumptions
and data considerations, including (1) including age 50 and above and (2) 65 and above as risk
factors for severe COVID-19; (3) excluding anyone who died within three days of index; (4) relaxing the mild COVID-19 requirement for eligible patients; (5) removing area-level statistics
from the propensity model; and (6) using a 90-day versus 180-day lookback for contraindicated
medications and medical conditions. In each we refit the propensity model and recalculated the
weights, and confirmed that balance on all covariates was attained. We conducted two
additional sensitivity analyses which were (7) excluding anyone with missing BMI information,
and (8) only including patients who received Paxlovid up to two days after index in the treatment
group.
We then used total recorded COVID-19-related hospitalizations, deaths, and COVID-19 cases
between December 2021 and February 202321 in addition to our risk ratio estimates to obtain
projections of the proportion and number of preventable hospitalizations and deaths at varying
levels of Paxlovid uptake and eligibility. Details for these calculations are provided in the
Supplement.",,"We included baseline characteristics informed by prior research4,6,10 and clinical expertise,
related to both Paxlovid use and hospitalization/death, which included patient demographics,
comorbidities, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and various ZIP code area-level statistics (see
Supplement). For patients with only 3-digit ZIP codes, area-level statistics were imputed using
the aggregated average of the variables in the component 5-digit ZIP codes.","Patients were more likely to receive Paxlovid if they received
one or more COVID-19 vaccines, were older, overweight or obese, had more than one risk
factor for severe COVID-19, were white, had more prior healthcare visits, or had history of
mental illness, asthma, smoking, or corticosteroid use. Several area-level statistics were also
significant predictors of Paxlovid treatment: education level, fraction of the local population that

At the time of study, these criteria included Down’s syndrome, solid cancer, haematological diseases (including cancers), renal disease, liver disease, immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, immune deficiencies, HIV/AIDS, solid-organ and stem-cell transplant recipients and rare neurological conditions.2,3 Patients meeting the NHS highest-risk criteria were identified via the presence of International Classification of Disease version 10 and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes appearing at any time in the patient’s records since first registration in North West London. The SNOMED codes used are available in Additional File 2 (note that due to updates in the highest-risk criteria between this study and the previous descriptive analysis,19 the SNOMED codes used were also updated).
As per the inclusion criteria, patients were required to be non-hospitalised at the time of sotrovimab treatment; to be considered non-hospitalised at the time of treatment, patients must not have had an inpatient hospital visit (event from admission to discharge) starting on or before the date of treatment, unless the visit was a day case (in the NHS, a day case is a planned elective admission without a planned overnight stay, used to administer treatments under medical supervision or to conduct minor procedures) or the visit did not incur an overnight stay.","Patients were excluded if they received more than one COVID-19 treatment (sotrovimab, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir or remdesivir) in an outpatient setting before the index date, or were diagnosed with COVID-19 while hospitalised.","Patient characteristics were recorded, including age, sex, ethnicity, vaccination status and comorbidity history. Cohorts were described in relation to ‘highest-risk’ conditions which made patients eligible for early treatment with sotrovimab and antiviral therapies, as mentioned above, and other high-risk conditions which may make the patient susceptible to adverse outcomes from COVID-19 (see Table 1 for highest- and high-risk comorbidities). Continuous variables (e.g. age) were summarised using mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range and range. Categorical variables (e.g. sex) were described using frequencies and percentages. Values from ≥1 to <5 were suppressed to protect patient confidentiality and are reported as n<5, as per our study’s Information Governance and Data Privacy Impact Assessment approvals.
Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance baseline patient characteristics in the treated and untreated cohorts. Weights were derived based on propensity scores, which were further used in weighted Cox regression to adjust for measured confounders between the treated and untreated cohorts. Propensity scores (probability of treatment based on baseline covariates) were obtained using logistic regression or gradient boosting machine models. Propensity score models were used to predict the probability of treatment based on the following covariates: age, gender, time period of COVID-19 diagnosis (i.e. Omicron BA.1, BA.2 or BA.5, as defined above), presence of renal disease (binary), presence of multiple highest-risk conditions (≥2, binary), presence of high-risk conditions (binary), solid-organ transplant (binary), COVID vaccination status (binary), time since vaccination and ethnicity (a full list of variables and models is included in Additional File 1, Table S1). To obtain an appropriate estimation of the variance of the treatment effect and better control the type I error rate, inverse probability of treatment weights were stabilised.23 The balance in baseline characteristics between weighted treated and untreated groups was assessed using standardised differences. Cox proportional hazards models with stabilised weights were performed to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and/or COVID-19-related death among the overall cohort and the patient subgroups (Omicron subvariant prevalence periods, age <65 years and ≥65 years, and patients with renal dysfunction). Covariates not balanced after weighting (standardised differences >0.1) were included in the Cox proportional hazards model. IPTWs and accordingly doubly robust estimation was performed separately for each Cox model.

Patients without evidence of at least one of the NHS highest-risk criteria for receiving early treatment were excluded from the main analysis. However, in our previous descriptive analysis, we observed that a high proportion of those prescribed sotrovimab (39.2%) did not have a code for a highest-risk condition.19 Therefore, we performed an exploratory analysis whereby a SNOMED code (1300561000000107; high-risk category for developing complication from coronavirus disease 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection) was used to identify patients who were identified as appropriate for ‘shielding’ during the early phase of the pandemic.",,,"Patients aged ≥65 years accounted for 35.2% (n=211/599) of the sotrovimab-treated group and 25.1% (n=1,302/5,191) of untreated patients.

Patients with treatment records of other antivirals or nMAbs after receiving the treatment under investigation were censored at the start date of that second treatment (n = 39).; we excluded those who initiated treatment more than seven days after a positive test date or had no positive test record, and those who were not classified as high-risk cohort member based on their health records","For the comparative effectiveness analysis of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus sotrovimab, distributions of baseline characteristics were compared between patients in these two treatment groups. Follow-up time of individual patients was calculated from the date of the treatment initiation record, until the earliest of: date of outcome event, 28 days after treatment initiation, initiation of a second nMAb/antiviral treatment, death, patient de-registration date, or the study end date (January 1, 2023).

Risks of 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death were compared between the two drug groups using Cox proportional hazards models, with time since treatment initiation as the time scale. The Cox models were stratified by area to account for geographic heterogeneity in baseline hazards, with sequential adjustment for other baseline covariates. Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; Model 2 additionally adjusted for high-risk cohort categories (Down syndrome, solid cancer, haematological disease, immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, immunosuppression, rare neurological conditions); Model 3 further adjusted for ethnicity (White or non-White), IMD quintiles, vaccination status, calendar date (with restricted cubic splines to account for non-linear effect); and Model 4 additionally adjusted for BMI category (<25 kg/m2, 25–<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac and respiratory diseases. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by testing for a zero slope in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each Cox model.

As an alternative approach to account for confounding bias, we used the propensity score weighting (PSW) method to balance the distributions of relevant covariates between groups. The propensity score (PS) for each patient is defined as the conditional probability of being treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, estimated with a binary logistic regression of the received treatment (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus sotrovimab) on relevant baseline covariates (different set of covariates were used for Models 1–4 as mentioned above). The average treatment effect (ATE) weighting scheme based on propensity scores (with and without trimming: approaches discussed further in results13,14) was then applied to the Cox model. Balance check of baseline covariates after weighting was conducted using standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups. Robust variance estimators were used in the weighted Cox model. Similar analyses were conducted for secondary outcomes.

Further exploratory analyses were conducted by different subgroups, including time period with different dominant variants (February 10–May 31 for BA.2, June 1–November 27 for BA.5/BQ.115), each high-risk cohort, presence of obesity (≥30 versus <30 kg/m2), diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac diseases or chronic respiratory diseases, days between test positive and treatment initiation (<3 versus 3–5 days), age group (<60 versus ≥60 years), sex and ethnicity (White versus non-White). Effect modification by each covariate was tested by adding the corresponding interaction term in the stratified Cox model, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

Several sensitivity analyses based on the stratified Cox model were conducted to assess the robustness of main findings, including (1) using complete-case analysis or Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations to deal with missing values in covariates; (2) additionally adjusting for time between test positive and treatment initiation, and time between last vaccination date and treatment initiation; (3) additionally adjusting for rural-urban classification, and other comorbidities and factors that might have influenced clinician’s choice of therapy through the patient’s ability to travel to hospital for an infusion (learning disabilities, severe mental illness, care home residency or housebound status); (4) using restricted cubic splines for age to control for potential non-linear age effect; (5) excluding patients with treatment records of both sotrovimab and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, or any other treatments during follow-up (i.e., casirivimab, molnupiravir, or remdesivir); (6) excluding patients who initiated treatment after 5 days since positive SARS-CoV-2 test; (7) adding back patients who did not have a positive test record before treatment or initiated treatment after 7 days since positive SARS-CoV-2 test; (8) adding back patients who had missing high-risk cohort information; (9) creating a 1-day or 2-day lag in the follow-up start date to account for potential delays in drug administration; (10) further excluding those with prescription records of any medications with potential interactions with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (i.e., in “Drugs consider risks and benefits” codelist)12 within 180 days before treatment of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or sotrovimab; (11) not excluding those with contraindications or “caution” medications for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir but adjusting for these conditions as covariates instead; (12) additionally adjusting for vaccine type for the latest COVID-19 vaccination, and then restricting the analysis to patients receiving the same type of vaccine; and (13) expanding the follow-up period to 90 days.

Finally, we adopted similar analytical approaches for the exploratory analysis comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users with molnupiravir users. Data management was performed using Python, with analysis carried out using Stata 16.1.",,,,"The mean age of these patients was 52.7 (SD = 14.9) years; 67% were female, 94% White and 93% had three or more COVID-19 vaccinations.
